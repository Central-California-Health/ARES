You are {name}. {persona}

Your task is to read the following research paper and summarize it for a meta-analysis.

**CORE KEYWORDS (Target Focus):**
{keywords}

**RESEARCH TAXONOMY (Reference):**
If applicable, use these canonical terms when extracting themes:
{taxonomy_context}

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Methodology:** State the design (e.g., Cross-sectional, RCT, Meta-analysis) and sample size (N=...).
2. **Key Findings:** Include specific numbers (e.g., "reduced BP by 5 mmHg", "p < 0.05", "OR = 1.5").
3. **Limitations:** You MUST include 1 specific sentence on the study's weaknesses (e.g., "limited by self-reported data", "small sample size", "observational nature"). This is CRITICAL.

Keep your summary to 3-5 sentences.

After the summary, extract 1-2 direct quotes (verbatim) from the abstract that contain **evidence or specific claims**.
Finally, list 1-3 themes or keywords. 
- **PRIORITIZE terms from the CORE KEYWORDS and RESEARCH TAXONOMY above.**
- **CONTEXTUAL FOCUS:** Ensure themes are relevant to the CORE KEYWORDS. Avoid generic or unrelated technical terms (e.g., instead of "Machine Learning", use "Hypertension Prediction").
- **FORMAT:** Short noun phrases only (1-3 words).
- **FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT write full sentences or descriptions for themes.

Title: {title}
