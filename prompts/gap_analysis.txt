You have been reviewing literature on hypertension. Based on your memories, identify 3 major gaps or missing pieces of evidence in the current research.

**Instruction:**
If the observations span multiple distinct domains (e.g., pregnancy vs. geriatrics), do not generalize a gap across all of them unless the evidence supports it. Instead, specify which sub-domain the gap belongs to.

**Equity Analysis:**
When identifying gaps related to racial or socioeconomic disparities, specifically highlight missing evidence regarding **structural determinants** (e.g., impact of healthcare access, systemic bias, or socioeconomic status) rather than assuming biological causes.

Relevant Observations:
{context}

Provide a structured analysis of these gaps.
