Methods and Results-To prepare for future cardiovascular care needs, the American Heart Association developed methodology to project future costs of care for hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVD from 2010 to 2030. This methodology avoided double counting of costs for patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions. By 2030, 40.5% of the US population is projected to have some form of CVD. Between 2010 and 2030, real (2008$) total direct medical costs of CVD are projected to triple, from $273 billion to $818 billion. Real indirect costs (due to lost productivity) for all CVD are estimated to increase from $172 billion in 2010 to $276 billion in 2030, an increase of 61%.

Currently, CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States and constitutes 17% of overall national health expenditures. US medical expenditures are the highest in the world and rose from 10% of the Gross Domestic Product in 1985 to 15% of Gross Domestic Product in 2008. In the past decade, the medical costs of CVD have grown at an average annual rate of 6% and have accounted for \u03f715% of the increase in medical spending. The growth in costs has been accompanied by greater life expectancy, suggesting that this spending was of value. Despite this trend, there are many opportunities to further improve cardiovascular health while controlling costs. To optimally plan for these opportunities, however, it is imperative to understand the future of CVD prevalence and costs. Previous projections have focused on disease states such as stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD), or have evaluated the implications of broadly defined \"heart disease.\" Systematic projections of prevalence and costs for all the major categories of CVD are not currently available. This study was undertaken to project the prevalence and medical costs of hypertension, CHD, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVDs from 2010 to 2030.

With the aging population, the prevalence of all CVD is projected to increase. People \u03fe65 years of age (especially \u03fe80 years of age) have a higher prevalence for all CVD, and this population segment will grow significantly in the next 2 decades. These increases translate to an additional 27 million people with hypertension, 8 million with CHD, 4 million with stroke, and 3 million with heart failure in 2030 relative to 2010. By 2030, 40.5% of the US population is projected to have some form of CVD.\nBetween 2010 and 2030, real (2008$) total direct medical costs of CVD are projected to triple, from $272.5 billion to $818.1 billion (Table ). Because it has a higher prevalence than other CVD conditions, hypertension is the most expensive component of CVD. Annual costs directly attributable to hypertension are projected to increase $130.4 billion (in real 2008$) in 2030 compared with 2010, for a total projected annual cost of $200.3 billion by 2030. If the costs of hypertension are expanded to include how much the presence of hypertension adds to the treatment of sequelae (ie, costs of hypertension as a risk factor), the increase in annual spending from 2010 to 2030 is $258.3 billion, with a projected annual total cost of $389.0 billion (in real 2008$) by 2030. Real medical costs of CHD and heart failure are projected to increase by \u03f7200% over the next 20 years, and stroke is projected to have the largest relative increase in real annual medical costs of 238%.\nReal indirect costs for all CVDs are estimated to increase from $171.7 billion in 2010 to $275.8 billion in 2030, an increase of 61% (Table ). CHD has the highest indirect cost and is expected to continue to account for \u03f740% of all CVD indirect costs. Real indirect (lost productivity) costs of CVD are expected to grow over the next 20 years, but not as fast as the growth in direct medical costs (Figure ). By 2030, the projected total cost of CVD, including direct and indirect costs, exceeds $1 trillion ($818.1 billion \u03e9 $275.8 billion) (real 2008$). The aging of the population combined with the growth in per capita medical spending are the primary drivers of increased CVD costs, which are expected to grow the fastest for ages 65 and over (Figure ). The aging of the population has less of an impact on indirect costs than direct costs because of the lower rates of employment among the elderly. Annual CVD costs for people aged 65 to 79 years are projected to increase by 238%, from $135 billion to $457 billion per year. By 2018, CVD costs among those aged 65 to 79 years are expected to exceed CVD costs among those aged 45 to 64 years.", "heading": "Results"}, {"text": "The current study found that the prevalence of CVD will increase by \u03f710% over the next 20 years under status-quo CVD prevention and treatment trends (ie, assuming no change to current policy), whereas the direct costs will increase almost 3-fold. Direct costs of CVD will continue to account for a relatively stable and large share of overall medical expenditures. By 2030, we estimate that \u03fe40% of US adults, or 116 million people, will have one or more forms of CVD.\nThese projections assume no change in policy over the time period but do reflect the demographics of an aging population and a relative increase in the proportion of Hispanic individuals. If some risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and obesity) continue to increase rapidly, we may see a greater increase in CVD prevalence and the associated costs. Recent studies using the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model forecast that current adolescent overweight will increase future adult obesity by 5% to 15% by 2035, resulting in \u03fe100 000 excess prevalent cases of CHD, whereas associated costs will increase by $254 billion. Conversely, estimates using the Archimedes Model found that if everyone received the 11 recommended prevention activities, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced by 63% and 31%, respectively, in the next 30 years. At more feasible levels of performance, myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced by 36% and 20%.

It does not include hypertension as a risk factor. \u2020This category includes a portion of the costs of complications associated with hypertension, including CHF, CHD, stroke, and other CVD. The costs of hypertension as a risk factor should not be summed with other CVD conditions to calculate the costs of all CVD.\nstudies have demonstrated that individuals with favorable levels of major atherosclerotic risks have a marked reduction in the onset of CHD and heart failure. Similarly, people who follow a healthy lifestyle experience a comparably reduced risk of CHD and stroke. Therefore, a greater focus on prevention may alter these CVD projections in the future.\nImproving population-level risk factors has clearly had a dominant impact on the decline in CVD death rates in the United States in the past. Smoking rates have declined since the first Surgeon General's report on adverse effects of smoking in 1964. In addition, efforts to reduce dietary fat intake in the 1960s and 1970s, treat hypertension in the 1970s and 1980s (National High Blood Pressure Education Program), and improve blood lipid levels in the 1980s and 1990s (National Cholesterol Education Program) have likely contributed to dramatically reduced CVD death rates through declines in risk factors in the population. In addition to population-based strategies, indi-vidual interventions to treat high-risk individuals have a valuable complementary role in CVD risk reduction. Unfortunately, the adverse trends in obesity threaten to undermine the progress made from declining smoking rates. Emerging evidence suggests that CVD prevention should begin earlier in life. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, initial risk factor levels in those under age 30 years were predictive of established subclinical atherosclerosis at 15 years follow-up, and those with risk factors above optimal levels were 2-to 3-fold more likely to have subclinical disease. It is noteworthy that individuals who reach middle age with optimal levels of all major risk factors, the remaining lifetime risk of developing CVD is only 6% to 8%. Modest improvements in risk factors earlier in life can have a greater impact than more substantial reductions later in life. In one study, a genetic variant resulting in a modest 28% reduction in low-$0 $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 $300 $350 $400 $450 $500 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Billions 2008$ 18-44 45-64 65-79 80+ density lipoprotein cholesterol from birth resulted in 88% reduction in the risk of CHD, which is in contrast to the 20% to 30% reduction seen with a 30% reduction in low-density lipoprotein with statin medications initiated at middle and older ages. Overall, hypertension has the greatest projected medical cost. The increased prevalence of hypertension is in part attributable to the aging of the population. However, analyses from the NHANES surveys from the years 1988 to 1991 to 1999 to 2000 revealed a 15% relative increase in the prevalence of hypertension after age adjustment and this prevalence has continued to increase through more recent NHANES surveys. Increasing body mass index contributed to \u03fe50% of the increase in hypertension. Reversing the obesity epidemic will play a pivotal role in favorably impacting the projected hypertension trends. Hypertension accounts for 18% of CVD deaths in Western countries and is a major risk factor for stroke, CHD, and heart failure. Thus, the total medical costs for hypertension inclusive of these downstream diseases are approximately double the cost of hypertension itself, making hypertension a particularly valuable target to modify the future total costs of CVD.\nA reduction in sodium intake is a promising goal for prevention and treatment of hypertension. A recent analysis using the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model estimated that reducing dietary salt by 3 g per day per person would reduce the annual number of new cases of CHD by 60 000 to 120 000, stroke by 32 000 to 66 000, and myocardial infarction by 54 000 to 99 000 and reduce the annual number of deaths from any cause by 44 000 to 92 000. Interest is growing in more personalized approaches to CVD prevention that can involve the assessment of genetic variants, biomarkers (eg, C-reactive protein) and imaging modalities (eg, coronary artery calcium scoring) to refine risk assessment and individually tailor prevention recommendations. Whether and how these will improve prevention or treatment of CVD and alter their future projections is yet to be realized. Despite the great enthusiasm for personalized medicine, further studies are needed to determine whether these personalized approaches are superior (or complementary) to population-based approaches to CVD prevention.", "heading": "Potential Impact of CVD Prevention"}, {"text": "Changes in access to CVD providers and services may alter these projections in the future. Primary and secondary prevention of CVD requires a team approach with professionals prepared in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, nutrition, social work, and other disciplines. The projected lack of US healthcare professionals in the fields of nursing, pharmacy, and medicine are of particular concern.\nThe shortage in nursing has been well described and is projected to grow to 260 000 registered nurses by 2025. Although the percentage of nurses working exclusively with individuals with heart disease is unknown, the projected shortage is double that of any nursing shortage experienced since the mid-1960s and will likely negatively affect patient care. This shortage will be fueled by a rapidly aging workforce; a large segment of the registered nurse population is scheduled to retire over the next decade. Furthermore, as our healthcare system adopts a team-based approach to care, the demand for nurses with advanced education to fill managerial and quality improvement roles will increase substantially. Pharmacists are also critical to the care of patients with cardiac disease. Currently, \u03fe8000 vacancies exist in retail pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and other industry sectors, and these figures are expected to worsen over time. Finally, a looming shortage of physicians prompted the Council on Graduate Medical Education to recommend a 15% increase in 2003. More recently, the president of the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended that US medical schools increase the annual number of graduates by 30%. However, a large fraction of new US physicians come from non-US medical schools and it is unclear whether their numbers can be increased based on needs. Another barrier to increasing the number of physicians is the current Medicare payment program that limits the number of residency training positions funded annually.\nAlthough primary care physicians are already in short supply, a significant shortage is growing in cardiac specialty care. A recent report estimated that there is a shortage of 1600 general cardiologists and 2000 interventional cardiologists. The current number of cardiologists would need to double by 2050 to erase the expected shortage of 16 000 cardiologists, if current trends continue. An even more marked shortfall is looming for cardiac surgery. Since 1975, the American Board of Thoracic Surgery has certified 4500 cardiothoracic surgeons. In recent years, this rate has dropped to \u03f7100 new cardiothoracic residents completing training annually. At this rate, and taking into account death, retirement, and attrition, it is estimated that only 3000 practicing cardiothoracic surgeons will be in practice in the year 2030. Thus, the overall access of the population to cardiovascular care will likely be significantly limited without an active effort to enhance the recruitment of personnel into the various health professions responsible for prevention and treatment of CVD.", "heading": "Will the Provider Workforce Be Adequate?"}, {"text": "Disparities in incidence and outcomes for CVD, are observed across socioeconomic gradients and across geographic regions. Non-Hispanic blacks bear a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality attributable to CVD. Our projections indicate that the aging of the population will not change this pattern; blacks, averaged over age and sex cells, are projected to have continued higher prevalence rates for CVD (not reported).\nPrimary or secondary prevention of CVD is less common in disadvantaged individuals and communities. Such differences could be reduced by implementation of systems of care for such patients. Thus, there is a great opportunity to improve the health of the disadvantaged populations by dissemination and implementation of effective prevention strategies. For example, an average 3 g per person reduction in daily salt (1200 mg of sodium) intake is expected to reduce CHD by 15% among black men and women compared with a 10% reduction for nonblack men and women. Similar reductions (greater in blacks than nonblacks) would be expected for stroke and total mortality.", "heading": "Future Disparities in Care"}, {"text": "Care can also be improved through either the development of new guidelines and technologies or improved use of the existing guidelines. In an effort to increase the use of evidence-based practices, the American Heart Association has partnered with the American College of Cardiology and other professional societies to produce guidelines for the care and prevention of CVD. Other prevention-oriented guidelines have been produced by the National Institutes of Health (eg, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III) and the European Society of Cardiology. Although some providers expressed concern about loss of autonomy and decreased satisfaction with medical practice early on, subsequent studies demonstrated that guidelines can improve care. However, the implementation of a new practice guideline is often slow and modest given the passive nature of dissemination and diffusion.\nMany have recognized that focusing on a few of the most important care strategies of a guideline can have a clinical impact. Accordingly, select measures, often referred to as performance measures, have been identified by accrediting bodies (eg, The Joint Commission), and payers (eg, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in conjunction with the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology). By publicly reporting these measures, requiring a certain level of performance for accreditation, and, in certain cases, linking performance on these measures to the hospital director's compensation (Veterans Administration Healthcare system), adherence has risen dramatically for many of these measures.\nPerformance measures are a key component of the Get With The Guidelines program of the American Heart Association. Not only have hospitals been shown to improve care dramatically over time, those providing the highest levels of care based on the performance measures have better patient survival rates than hospitals not performing at the highest level. These findings indicate that guidelines and performance measures can have a substantial impact on prevention and treatment and will be an important tool for limiting the burden of CVD.", "heading": "Using Guidelines to Improve Care"}, {"text": "The US healthcare system often rewards practices that treat disease and injury rather than those that prevent them. This has resulted in a population health status that has remained relatively unchanged in this decade despite exponential increases in healthcare spending. As our nation debates healthcare reform policies, we must realize that a variety of policy-and practice-related measures will be necessary to affect real change in the healthcare system. Expanding access to affordable healthcare coverage may provide important benefits for individuals with CVD. We must reorient our healthcare system toward implementing effective health promotion and disease prevention. This metamorphosis is not unrealistic and provides an exciting opportunity and call to action. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is committed to strengthening our collective capacity to protect and improve the nation's health by responding to increasingly complex challenges, in particular, our epidemic of chronic diseases. Prevention at the community level is one such avenue to reduce the projected burden of CVD. Community prevention efforts may include greater tobacco control, elimination of artificial trans fat, reducing dietary sodium intake, reducing air pollution, reducing obesity, and increasing physical activity with a focus on children and the design of new communities.\nThe increased use of electronic medical records is also recommended and could have a positive impact on the prevention of CVD. The ability to systematically identify all patients with risk factors for CVD, address their barriers to care, and hopefully provide improved access to preventive care should result in beneficial alterations in current trends.\nIt should be recognized that, although prevention will delay or even prevent the onset of CVD and the cost of cardiovascular treatment, 66 patients will need medical care longer and the lifetime cost of care may not be reduced as patients live longer. Thus, prevention strategies should not be evaluated solely on their ability to reduce cost of care, but instead they should be valued based on a combination of cost and impact on patient well being, including the length and quality of life.", "heading": "Policy Implications and Future Opportunities"}, {"text": "The projections are subject to sampling error in the underlying surveys; however, the combination of such a large number of data sources prevented calculation of confidence intervals. The human capital approach, as implemented, did not include the time value of informal caregivers of those with CVD. In general, the human capital approach does not capture the psychological costs of morbidity and, therefore, probably undervalues the morbidity costs for those not in the labor force. Our analysis did not separate out arrhythmias from other types of CVD. Atrial fibrillation, one of the most common types of arrhythmia, is projected to more than double in the next 40 years. It is important to note that our analysis did not assume any change in the prognosis of disease once established. To the extent that adherence to recommended treatments increases, or new life-prolonging technologies are developed, the prevalence of CVD will increase because patients will live longer with disease. However, if a reduction in the level of risk factors occurs, the prevalence and associated costs will be overestimated. Our study also assumed a continued acceleration of healthcare spending for CVD based on historical trends. If investment in new CVD technologies wanes, fewer advances in care will occur and will impact costs.\nThe authors acknowledge that differences exist between CVD cost estimates for 2010 presented in this statement and those previously published in the Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2010 Update: A Report From the American Heart Association. For this study, we used more recent data and a different methodology for estimating medical (direct) costs of CVD that minimizes double counting disease costs across categories.

The survey includes an interview and a physical examination component where the interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and healthrelated questions and the examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. The prevalence of hypertension was based on blood pressure measurements and the responses to interview questions about being told of having high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications.

A list of qualifying measures and questions used to define each condition is presented in Table .\nWe estimated the prevalence of each CVD condition by use of logistic regression models controlling for survey year and demographics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity). Stepwise regressions were used to determine the significant interactions of the demographics to be included in the models.

The costs captured by MEPS represent payments (not charges) from the payer to the provider. MEPS spending data are obtained through a combination of selfreport and validation from payers (eg, private insurers).\nProjections of the direct medical costs of CVD were estimated in 5 steps. First, we estimated per person medical costs as a function of health conditions using a 2-part regression model. In the first part of the 2-part model, we used a logistic regression model to predict the probability of any expenditures. For the second part of the model, we used a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and a log link to estimate total annual medical expenditures for people having any expenditures. We used an algorithm for choosing among alternative nonlinear estimators recommended by Manning and Mullahy and found that this type of model was the most appropriate for the data. Our model controlled for CVD conditions and other potentially costly or prevalent medical conditions and sociodemographic variables.\nSecond, expenditures attributable to each CVD condition were calculated as the difference in predicted expenditures for a person with the specified condition and predicted expenditures for a similar person without the condition. We estimated the per person cost attributable to each CVD condition for each age/sex/race cell based on coefficients from the national, pooled model.\nDisease-attributable expenditures are typically calculated by predicting expenditures using observed diseases and subtracting from that predicted expenditures setting the disease of interest (eg, CHD) to zero and leaving all other covariates and diseases as they are in the data. However, in previous work, we have shown that, in nonlinear models, such as that the model used here, this approach will lead to double counting of expenditures for co-occurring diseases, regardless of whether one disease causes the other. Double counting of expenditures is a particular problem in cases where more than one condition is treated during a single office visit or hospitalization. We used a technique, termed \"complete classification\" and described in an earlier study, to ensure that no double counting occurs. Using the parameters of the econometric model, we specifically treated each disease and combination of diseases observed in the data as its own separate entity when calculating the attributable costs. For example, CHD alone and CHD with hypertension would be treated as 2 different diseases in the attributable expenditure calculation described above. We then divided the total expenditures attributable to the combinations of diseases back to the constituent diseases using the parameters from the model to construct shares for each constituent disease within a combination (ie, a share of all CHD with hypertension disease costs that are attributable to CHD). The shares attribute a greater share of the joint expenditures to the disease with the larger coefficient in the main effect. The formula to construct the shares is given in Trogdon, Finkelstein, and Hoerger. Our third step in calculating projections of direct medical costs was to adjust the per person cost estimates to account for nursing home spending by use of data from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey and National Health Accounts. We assumed that per person, non-nursing home expenditures attributable to CVD were the same for the nursing home population as for the noninstitutionalized population.\nFourth, to estimate projected costs, we first followed recommendations from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to inflate dollar values in the MEPS data to 2008. We then multiplied the per person cost of each CVD condition in each sex/age/race cell by the projected number of people treated for each disease in the corresponding cells for years 2010 to 2030 and summed across CVD conditions to estimate total medical costs of CVD. The projected number of people treated for each disease was calculated by using similar methodology as outlined in the Prevalence Section. However, instead of the NHANES data, we used 1996 to 2005 MEPS to predict the treated prevalence of each condition, because only those patients who receive treatment incur medical costs within a certain year.\nFinally, we used Congressional Budget Office assumptions for future healthcare cost growth above and beyond growth due to population growth and aging. We assumed that the costs of CVD would increase at the same rate as overall medical expenditures between 2010 and 2030: an average annual rate of 3.6%.", "heading": "Appendix A: Data Definitions"}, {"text": "Two types of indirect costs were calculated: lost productivity from (1) morbidity and (2) premature mortality.", "heading": "Projections of Indirect Costs of CVD"}, {"text": "Morbidity costs represent the value of foregone earnings from lost productivity due to CVD. Morbidity costs include 3 components: work loss among currently employed individuals, home productivity loss, and work loss among individuals too sick to work. Per capita work loss days due to CVD by age, sex, and race/ethnicity were estimated by use of 2001 to 2005 MEPS. We estimated a negative binomial model for annual days of work missed because of illness or injury as a function of CVD, other comorbid conditions, and sociodemographic variables. Per capita work days lost because of CVD for each age/sex/ race cell were based on coefficients from the national, pooled model. As for medical expenditures, we avoided double counting of costs resulting from individuals with multiple conditions by using the previously cited procedure. We generated total work loss costs by multiplying per capita work days lost owing to CVD by (1) prevalence of CVD (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity) from MEPS, (2) the probability of employment given CVD (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity) from MEPS, (3) mean per capita daily earnings (by age and sex) from the 2008 Current Population Survey, and (4) Census population projections counts (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity).\nHome productivity loss was estimated by valuing days spent in bed because of CVD at the replacement cost of housekeeping services. Per capita days in bed because of CVD by age, sex, and race/ethnicity were estimated by using 2001 to 2005 MEPS and the same strategy as outlined above for work days lost. We generated total home productivity loss costs by multiplying per capita bed days due to CVD by (1) prevalence of CVD (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity) from MEPS, (2) dollar value of a day of house work (by age and sex), and (3) Census population projections counts (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity).\nTo estimate work loss among individuals too sick to work because of CVD, we first estimated the number of people too sick to work who would have been employed, with the exception of their CVD. For the noninstitutionalized population, we multiplied the number of people not in the labor force because of illness/disability by age from the Current Population Survey 75 by the percentage of all work loss because of CVD based on the MEPS regression analysis for work loss days described above. The assumption was that the percentage of work days missed because of CVD was the same for days missed by being out of the labor force and for days missed conditional on working. For the institutionalized population, we multiplied the number of people with a primary diagnosis of CVD from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey (as percentage of total population) by Census population counts and the probability of employment given CVD (by age, sex, and race/ethnicity) from MEPS. The last component accounts for individuals with CVD who might not work even if they had not been institutionalized.

We included studies that had as population of interest adult patients with essential hypertension in an ambulatory setting. The interventions included all those that aimed to improve blood pressure control. The outcomes assessed were mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, control of blood pressure and the proportion of patients followed up at clinic. Fifty six randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria.

The trials showed a wide variety of methodological quality, part of which may be attributed to poor reporting. An organized system of regular review allied to vigorous antihypertensive drug therapy was shown to reduce blood pressure and all-cause mortality in a single large RCT-the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up study. Other interventions had variable effects. Self-monitoring was associated with moderate net reductions in diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.0 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.7 to -1.4 mmHg.

Evidence from randomized trials has shown that effective drug treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ). However, there is ongoing concern that the benefits demonstrated in randomized trials of antihypertensive drug treatment are not implemented in everyday clinical practice . Community-based studies throughout the world show that blood pressure goals are achieved in only 25-40% of the patients who take antihypertensive drug treatment , a situation that has remained unchanged for the last 30 years .\nThe quality of care patients with hypertension receive from health professionals has a clear impact on their risk of suffering a cardiovascular event. Observational studies in the UK have shown that inadequate control of blood pressure is associated with a significant risk of stroke . In terms of the process of care that hypertensive patients receive, characteristics of both the patient, health professional and the healthcare system in which they are given their medical care have been implicated in poor blood pressure control. Lack of adherence to medication and not having a primary care physician were associated with poor blood pressure control in a US study . More recent studies have shown that frequent contact with health care pro-fessionals does not guarantee better blood pressure control unless there is more vigorous use of antihypertensive drugs , and that individual practitioners vary substantially in their clinical performance when managing hypertension in the community . These observations have led some commentators to suggest that poor control of blood pressure in the community may be due to ineffective management and inadequate practice organisation, described jointly as \"clinical inertia\" (Phillips 2001).\nWhilst there is a strong evidence-base for the benefits of antihypertensive drug therapy , there is little clear evidence as to how care for hypertensive patients should be organized and delivered in the community to help improve blood pressure control.

Though partly intended as a trial to assess the value of systematic identification of hypertensive patients (Davis 2001), the key ingredients of how patients with established hypertension and taking antihypertensive drug treatment were managed-free care, registration, recall and regular review in tandem with a rigorous stepped care approach to antihypertensive drug treatment-should be emphasized as this multi-faceted intervention was effective in terms of reaching blood pressure goals and reducing all-cause mortality. It is interesting to note that a two-year post trial surveillance study showed that blood pressure control was attenuated when the stepped-care arm of the study was discontinued. This lack of control was associated with a decline in the use of antihypertensive medication .\nOther interventions assessed in this systematic review did not produce clear results. None of the interventions were associated with large, clinically important, reductions in either systolic or diastolic pressure, see MetaView. Self-monitoring was associated with a significant decline in diastolic blood pressure and further evaluation in larger RCTs is warranted. Education alone, directed either to patients or health professionals appears unlikely to influence control of blood pressure as a single intervention, as results were highly heterogeneous or of marginal clinical importance. Use of health care professionals such as nurses and pharmacists, though producing significantly heterogeneous results, did have mainly favourable effects, and merit further definitive evaluation in larger RCTs. Lastly, reminders (postal or computer-based) were associated with an improvement in the follow up of patients with hypertension in all RCTs aside from one small study. This finding is consistent with the organisational structure of the HDFP study and re-iterates the importance of systematic recall systems when organising care for hypertensive patients.", "heading": "Key findings from this review"}, {"text": "There are elements identified from this review that appear to be associated with improved blood pressure control and are consistent with findings from observational studies and previous systematic reviews. In a large community-based study, patients who received intensive antihypertensive drug therapy were significantly more likely to have reduced systolic blood pressure of 6.3 mmHg compared to an increase of 4.8 mmHg in those who received less intensive antihypertensive drug therapy . A more recent observational study showed that antihypertensive drug therapy was initiated or changed in only 38% of episodes of care, despite documented uncontrolled hypertension for at least six months . Lack of practice organisation is associated with a failure to achieve treatment surrogate goals in hypertension, diabetes and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease . A recent systematic review of self monitoring also produced similar findings of modest but potentially important benefit (Cappuccio 2004).\nWe have found substantially more RCT evidence in terms of hypertension management than a recent systematic review that examined interventions used in disease management programmes for patients with chronic illness . In this re-view, eight hypertension-related RCTs were cited which provided some evidence of benefit in terms of education directed at the patient and provider (health professional) . In this systematic review of 56 RCTs, the subset of RCTs where the intervention was directed at the patient (n=16) or physician (n=9) does not support this finding, showing no clinically important evidence for patient or health professional education as an effective implementation strategy in the management of hypertension.", "heading": "Context of other studies"}, {"text": "There are several shortcomings that need to be highlighted in this systematic review. The HDFP study was designed as an intervention that would identify newly diagnosed hypertensive patients and then start or modify antihypertensive treatment in those with untreated as well as uncontrolled hypertension . A consequence of this study design is that a differential number of people were receiving antihypertensive drug treatment in the two arms, percentage of patients taking antihypertensive medicationhigher for stepped care 81.2%, compared to referred care 64.2% at follow-up in year 5 (see details on included studies). So though it appears that the systematic follow-up and stepped care approach in HDFP is an important element in effective clinical care and prompts rigorous antihypertensive drug treatment, it is not possible to distinguish between the independent effect of these interventions on blood pressure control. Several other RCTs included both treated and untreated hypertensive patients and had differential rates of antihypertensive drug prescribing , with rates of prescribing at higher levels in the intervention arm at follow up. Secondly, many RCTs contained multi-faceted interventions that did not fit into a single intervention category. For example several RCTs that were included under categories of patient education, physician education, health professional led care and organisation of care also incorporated some form of reminder intervention such as postal reminders or computer generated feedback . Consequently, it has been difficult to attribute how far single elements that make up complex interventions exert their independent effect on blood pressure control. In terms of self monitoring, it is well established that \"office\" blood pressure readings are around 10/5mmHg higher when compared to ambulatory or self monitored readings . Several of the RCTs did not make any recommendations about the need for adjustment of target blood pressure readings when self monitoring was the intervention being assessed, nor did they appear to anticipate lower blood pressure readings in the self monitoring group . This may have attenuated the impact of self monitoring on blood pressure control because of failure to intensify treatement. Poor adherence to therapy is thought to be associated with poor control of blood pressure (Shea 1992). Only a few trials examined the relation between adherence to medication and control of blood pressure . Future studies will need to be designed to assess the relationship between poor adherence and poor response to antihypertensive drugs in patients with good adherence. Lastly, not all RCTs reported on the outcomes of blood pressure achieved or blood pressure control. This has meant that the relevant a priori outcomes have not been reported for all included RCTs, and pooling of data from all RCTs has not been possible.", "heading": "Study limitations"}, {"text": null, "heading": "A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S"}, {"text": "Despite these limitations important messages emerge from this systematic review. Effective delivery of hypertensive care requires a systematic approach in the community, incorporating regular review of patients and a willingness to intensify antihypertensive drug treatment, usually by adding additional classes of antihypertensive drugs, when blood pressure goals are not being met . This approach of intensive drug therapy and \"tight\" control of blood pressure has been demonstrated to be possible in clinical trials in hypertensive and diabetic patients alike (Hansson 1999; UK PDS 1998). There are reports of successful systematic care of hypertensive patients in the community over a 20 year period , but the challenge is to translate these findings into usual clinical care.", "heading": "Implications for practice"}, {"text": "In terms of future studies, careful preliminary work is needed when developing and testing complex interventions and thought needs to be given as to how their individual and combined effects are measured . Aside from definitive RCTs examining the effects of self-monitoring and allied health professional led care (pharmacist and nurses), there is also a paucity of evidence in terms of computer-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in hypertension and how adherence-enhancing strategies influence subsequent blood pressure control . HDFP was a well-funded study with substantial staffing resources. This meant that the \"stepped care\" intervention was provided by a highly motivated workforce. An economic evaluation of delivering organised care to hypertensive patients should accompany future studies. Lastly, none of the included RCTs attempted to manage hypertension in the context of overall cardiovascular risk. Future studies need to be congruent with hypertension guidelines that recommend treatment and control of blood pressure in combination with multi-factorial risk reduction (Ramsay 1999).", "heading": "Implications for research"}, {"text": "Effective delivery of hypertension care in the community requires a rigorous approach in terms of identification, follow-up and treatment with antihypertensive drugs. This systematic review shows that such an approach is likely to translate into reductions in car-diovascular mortality and morbidity . Supplementary and alternative models of care, including self monitoring of blood pressure by patients, blood pressure management by allied health care professionals and CDSSs require further development and evaluation. Educational interventions directed to either patients or health professionals alone are unlikely to produce clinically important reductions in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.", "heading": "Conclusions"}, {"text": null, "heading": "P O T E N T I A L C O N F L I C T O F I N T E R E S T"}, {"text": null, "heading": "None declared"}, {"text": "We are very grateful to Margaret Burke (Cochrane Heart Group) for help with searching.

Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120 -139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80 -89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (\u03fd140/90 mm Hg, or \u03fd130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount. (Hypertension. 2003;42:1206 -1252.) F or more than 3 decades, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has administered the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Coordinating Committee, a coalition of 39 major professional, public, and voluntary organizations and 7 federal agencies. One important function is to issue guidelines and advisories designed to increase awareness, prevention, treatment, and control of hypertension (high blood pressure).\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have indicated that 50 million or more Americans have high blood pressure (BP) warranting some form of treatment. 1,2 Worldwide prevalence estimates for", "sections": {"list": [{"text": "hypertension may be as much as 1 billion individuals, and approximately 7.1 million deaths per year may be attributable to hypertension. The World Health Organization reports that suboptimal BP (\u03fe115 mm Hg SBP) is responsible for 62% of cerebrovascular disease and 49% of ischemic heart disease, with little variation by sex. In addition, suboptimal blood pressure is the number one attributable risk for death throughout the world. Considerable success has been achieved in the past in meeting the goals of the program. The awareness of hypertension has improved from a level of 51% of Americans in the period 1976 to 1980 to 70% in 1999 to 2000 (Table ). The percentage of patients with hypertension receiving treatment has increased from 31% to 59% in the same period, and the percentage of persons with high BP controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg has increased from 10% to 34%. Between 1960 and 1991, median systolic BP (SBP) for individuals 60 to 74 years old declined by approximately 16 mm Hg (Figure ). These changes have been associated with highly favorable trends in the morbidity and mortality attributed to hypertension. Since 1972, age-adjusted death rates from stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) have declined by approximately 60% and 50%, respectively (Figures and ). These benefits have occurred independent of gender, age, race, or socioeconomic status. Within the last 2 decades, better treatment of hypertension has been associated with a considerable reduction in the hospital case-fatality rate for heart failure (HF) (Figure ). This information suggests that there have been substantial improvements.\nHowever, these improvements have not been extended to the total population. Current control rates for hypertension in the United States are clearly unacceptable. Approximately 30% of adults are still unaware of their hypertension, more than 40% of individuals with hypertension are not on treatment, and two thirds of hypertensive patients are not being controlled to BP levels less than 140/90 mm Hg (Table ). Furthermore, the rates of decline of deaths from CHD and stroke have slowed in the past decade. In addition, the prevalence and hospitalization rates of HF, wherein the majority of patients have hypertension before developing heart failure, have continued to increase (Figures and ). Moreover, there is an increasing trend in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by primary diagnosis. Hypertension is second only to diabetes as the most common antecedent for this condition (Figure ). Undiagnosed, untreated, and uncontrolled hypertension clearly places a substantial strain on the health care delivery system.", "heading": null}, {"text": "The decision to appoint a committee for The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) was based on 4 factors: the publication of many new hypertension observational studies and clinical trials since the last report was published in 1997 ; the need for a new clear and concise guideline that would be useful to clinicians; the need to simplify the classification of BP; and a clear recognition that the JNC reports did not result in maximum benefit to the public. This JNC report is presented in 2 separate publications. The initial \"Express\" version, a succinct practical guide, was published in the May 21, 2003, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The current, more comprehensive report provides a broader discussion and justification for the recommendations made by the committee. As with prior JNC reports, the TABLE 1.

To conduct this task, the Coordinating Committee is divided into 4 subcommittees: Science Base; Long Range Planning; Professional, Patient, and Public Education; and Program Organization. The subcommittees work together to review the hypertension scientific literature from clinical trials, epidemiology, and behavioral science. In many instances, the principal investigator of the larger studies has presented the information directly to the Coordinating Committee. The committee reviews are summarized and posted on the NHLBI web site. This ongoing review process keeps the committee apprised of the current state of the science, and the information is also used to develop program plans for future activities, such as continuing education.\nDuring fall 2002, the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee chair solicited opinions regarding the need to update the JNC 6 report. The entire Coordinating Committee membership provided, in writing, a detailed rationale explaining the necessity for updating JNC 6, outlined critical issues, and provided concepts to be addressed in the new report. Thereafter, the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee chair appointed the JNC 7 chair and an Executive Committee derived from the Coordinating Committee membership. The Coordinating Committee members served on 1 of 5 JNC 7 writing teams, which contributed to the writing and review of the document.\nThe concepts for the new report identified by the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee membership were used to create the report outline. On the basis of these critical issues and concepts, the Executive Committee developed relevant medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords to further review the scientific literature. These MeSH terms were used to generate MEDLINE searches that focused on English-language, peer-reviewed scientific literature from January 1997 through April 2003. Various systems of grading the evidence were considered, and the classification scheme used in JNC 6 and other NHBPEP clinical guidelines was selected. This scheme classifies studies according to a process adapted from Last and Abramson (see the section Scheme Used for Classification of the Evidence). In reviewing the exceptionally large body of research literature in hypertension, the Executive Committee focused its deliberations on evidence pertaining to outcomes of importance to patients and with effects of sufficient magnitude to warrant changes in medical practice (\"patient oriented evidence that matters\" [POEMs]). Patient-oriented outcomes include not only mortality but also other outcomes that affect patients' lives and well-being, such as sexual function, ability to maintain family and social roles, ability to work, and ability to carry out activities of daily living. These outcomes are strongly affected by nonfatal stroke, HF, coronary heart disease, and renal disease; hence, these outcomes were considered along with mortality in the committee's evidence-based deliberations. Studies of physiological end points (disease-oriented evidence [DOEs]) were used to address questions where POEMs were not available.\nThe Coordinating Committee began the process of developing the JNC 7 Express report in December 2002, and the report was submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association in April 2003. It was published in an electronic format on May 14, 2003, and in print on May 21, 2003. During this time, the Executive Committee met on 6 occasions, 2 of which included meetings with the entire Coordinating Committee. The writing teams also met by teleconference and used electronic communications to develop the report. Twenty-four drafts were created and reviewed repeatedly. At its meetings, the Executive Committee used a modified nominal group process to identify and resolve issues. The NHBPEP Coordinating Committee reviewed the penultimate draft and provided written comments to the Executive Committee. In addition, 33 national hypertension leaders reviewed and commented on the document. The NHBPEP Coordinating Committee approved the JNC 7 Express report. To complete the longer JNC 7 version, the Executive Committee members met via teleconferences and in person and circulated sections of the larger document via e-mail. The sections were assembled and edited by the JNC 7 chair and were circulated among the Coordinating Committee members for review and comment. The JNC 7 chair synthesized the comments, and the longer version was submitted to the journal Hypertension in November, 2003.", "heading": "Methods"}, {"text": "Hypertension is an increasingly important medical and public health issue. The prevalence of hypertension increases with advancing age to the point where more than half of people aged 60 to 69 years old and approximately three-fourths of those aged 70 years and older are affected. The age-related rise in SBP is primarily responsible for an increase in both incidence and prevalence of hypertension with increasing age. Whereas the short-term absolute risk for hypertension is conveyed effectively by incidence rates, the long-term risk is best summarized by the lifetime risk statistic, which is the probability of developing hypertension during the remaining years of life (either adjusted or unadjusted for competing causes of death). Framingham Heart Study investigators recently reported the lifetime risk of hypertension to be approximately 90% for men and women who were nonhypertensive at 55 or 65 years old and survived to age 80 to 85 (Figure ). Even after adjusting for competing mortality, the remaining lifetime risks of hypertension were 86 to 90% in women and 81 to 83% in men.\nThe impressive increase of BP to hypertensive levels with age is also illustrated by data indicating that the 4-year rates Figure .

For every 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic increase in BP, there is a doubling of mortality from both ischemic heart disease and stroke.\nIn addition, longitudinal data obtained from the Framingham Heart Study have indicated that BP values in the 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg range are associated with a more than 2-fold increase in relative risk from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those with BP levels below 120/ 80 mm Hg (Figure ).", "heading": "Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Risk"}, {"text": "Because of the new data on lifetime risk of hypertension and the impressive increase in the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with levels of BP previously considered to be normal, the JNC 7 report has introduced a new classification that includes the term \"prehypertension\" for those with BPs ranging from 120 to 139 mm Hg systolic and/or 80 to (The Lancet, 2002;360:1903-1913).\n89 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP). This new designation is intended to identify those individuals in whom early intervention by adoption of healthy lifestyles could reduce BP, decrease the rate of progression of BP to hypertensive levels with age, or prevent hypertension entirely.\nAnother change in classification from JNC 6 is the combining of stage 2 and stage 3 hypertension into a single stage 2 category. This revision reflects the fact that the approach to the management of the former two groups is similar (Table ).", "heading": "Basis for Reclassification of Blood Pressure"}, {"text": "Table provides a classification of BP for adults aged 18 and older. The classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated BP readings on each of 2 or more office visits.\nPrehypertension is not a disease category. Rather it is a designation chosen to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension, so that both patients and clinicians are alerted to this risk and encouraged to intervene and prevent or delay the disease from developing. Individuals who are prehypertensive are not candidates for drug therapy on the basis of their level of BP and should be firmly and unambiguously advised to practice lifestyle modification in order to reduce their risk of developing hypertension in the future (see the section Lifestyle Modifications). Moreover, individuals with prehypertension who also have diabetes or kidney disease should be considered candidates for appropriate drug therapy if a trial of lifestyle modification fails to reduce their BP to 130/80 mm Hg or less. This classification does not stratify hypertensives by the presence or absence of risk factors or target organ damage in order to make different treatment recommendations, if either or both are present. JNC 7 suggests that all people with hypertension (Stages 1 and 2) be treated. The treatment goal for individuals with hypertension and no other compelling conditions is \u03fd140/90 mm Hg (see the section Compelling Indications). The goal for individuals with prehypertension and no compelling indications is to lower BP to normal with lifestyle changes and prevent the progressive rise in BP using the recommended lifestyle modifications (See the section Lifestyle Modification).", "heading": "Classification of Blood Pressure"}, {"text": "The relationship between BP and risk of CVD events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.

Changing patterns of BP occur with increasing age. The rise in SBP continues throughout life, in contrast to DBP, which rises until approximately 50 years old, tends to level off over the next decade, and may remain the same or fall later in life (Figure ). Diastolic hypertension predominates before 50 years of age, either alone or in combination with SBP elevation. The prevalence of systolic hypertension increases with age, and above the age of 50 years, systolic hypertension represents the most common form of hypertension. DBP is a more potent cardiovascular risk factor than SBP until age 50; thereafter, SBP is more important (Figure ). Clinical trials have demonstrated that control of isolated systolic hypertension reduces total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and HF events. Both observational studies and clinical trial data suggest that poor SBP control is largely responsible for the unacceptably low rates of overall BP control. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) and Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular End Points (CONVINCE) trial, DBP control rates exceeded 90%, but SBP control rates were considerably less (60 to 70%). Poor SBP control is at least in part related to physician attitudes. A survey of primary care physicians indicated that three-fourths of them failed to initiate antihypertensive therapy in older individuals with SBP of 140 to 159 mm Hg, and most primary care physicians did not pursue control to less than 140 mm Hg. Most physicians have been taught that the diastolic pressure is more important than SBP and thus treat accordingly. Greater emphasis must clearly be placed on managing systolic hypertension. Otherwise, as the US population becomes older, the toll of uncontrolled SBP will cause increased rates of cardiovascular and renal diseases.", "heading": "Importance of Systolic Blood Pressure"}, {"text": "The prevention and management of hypertension are major public health challenges for the United States. If the rise in BP with age could be prevented or diminished, much of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease, and stroke might be prevented. A number of important causal factors for hypertension have been identified, including excess body weight; excess dietary sodium intake; reduced physical activity; inadequate intake of fruits, vegetables, and potassium; and excess alcohol intake. The prevalence of these characteristics is high. One hundred twenty-two million Americans are overweight or obese. Mean sodium intake is approximately 4100 mg per day for men and 2750 mg per day for women, 75% of which comes from processed foods. Fewer than 20% of Americans engage in regular physical activity, and fewer than 25% consume 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Because the lifetime risk of developing hypertension is very high (Figure ), a public health strategy that complements the hypertension treatment strategy is warranted. In order to prevent BP levels from rising, primary prevention measures should be introduced to reduce or minimize these causal factors in the population, particularly in individuals with prehypertension. A population approach that decreases the BP level in the general population by even modest amounts has the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality or at least delay the onset of hypertension. For example, it has been estimated that a 5 mm Hg reduction of SBP in the population would result in a 14% overall reduction in mortality due to stroke, a 9% reduction in mortality due to CHD, and a 7% decrease in all-cause mortality (Figure ). Barriers to prevention include cultural norms; insufficient attention to health education by health care practitioners; lack of reimbursement for health education services; lack of access to places to engage in physical activity; larger servings of food in restaurants; lack of availability of healthy food choices in many schools, worksites, and restaurants; lack of exercise programs in schools; large amounts of sodium added to foods by the food industry and restaurants; and the higher cost of food products that are lower in sodium and calories. Overcoming the barriers will require a multipronged approach directed not only to high-risk populations but also to communities, schools, worksites, and the food industry. The recent recommendations by the American Public Health Association and the NHBPEP Coordinating Committee that the food industry, including manufacturers and restaurants, reduce sodium in the food supply by 50% over the next decade is the type of approach that, if implemented, would reduce BP in the population.", "heading": "Prevention of Hypertension: Public Health Challenges"}, {"text": "Healthy People 2010 has identified the community as a significant partner and vital point of intervention for attaining healthy goals and outcomes. Partnerships with community groups such as civic, philanthropic, religious, and senior citizen organizations provide locally focused orientation to the health needs of diverse populations.

Persons should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair (rather than on an examination table), with feet on the floor, and arm supported at heart level. Caffeine, exercise, and smoking should be avoided for at least 30 minutes prior to measurement. Measurement of BP in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in those at risk for postural hypotension, prior to necessary drug dose or adding a drug, and in those who report symptoms consistent with reduced BP on standing. An appropriately sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm) should be used to ensure accuracy. At least two measurements should be made and the average recorded. For manual determinations, palpated radial pulse obliteration pressure should be used to estimate SBP; the cuff should then be inflated 20 to 30 mm Hg above this level for the auscultatory determinations; the cuff deflation rate for auscultatory readings should be 2 mm Hg per second. SBP is the point at which the first of two or more Korotkoff sounds is heard (onset of phase 1), and the disappearance of Korotkoff sound (onset of phase 5) is used to define DBP.

BP has a reproducible circadian profile, with higher values while awake and mentally and physically active, much lower values during rest and sleep, and early morning increases for 3 or more hours during the transition of sleep to wakefulness. These devices use either a microphone to measure Korotkoff sounds or a cuff that senses arterial waves using oscillometric techniques. Twenty-four-hour BP monitoring provides multiple readings during all of a patient's activities. While office BP values have been used in the numerous studies that have established the risks associated with an elevated BP and the benefits of lowering BP, office measurements have some shortcomings. For example, a white-coat effect (increase in BP primarily in the medical care environment) is noted in as many as 20 to 35% of patients diagnosed with hypertension.\n61 TABLE 4.

ABPM also provides a measure of the percentage of BP readings that are elevated, the overall BP load, and the extent of BP fall during sleep. In most people, BP drops by 10 to 20% during the night; those in whom such reductions are not present appear to be at increased risk for cardiovascular events. In addition, it was reported recently that ABPM patients whose 24-hour BP exceeded 135/85 mm Hg were nearly twice as likely to have a cardiovascular event as those with 24-hour mean BPs less than 135/85 mm Hg, irrespective of the level of the office BP.

Optional tests include measurement of urinary albumin excretion or albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), except for those with diabetes or kidney disease, for whom annual measurements should be made. More extensive testing for identifiable causes is not indicated generally unless BP control is not achieved or the clinical and routine laboratory evaluation strongly suggests an identifiable secondary cause (ie, vascular bruits, symptoms of catecholamine excess, unprovoked hypokalemia). See the section Identifiable Causes of Hypertension for a more thorough discussion.\nThe presence of decreased GFR or albuminuria has prognostic implications as well. Studies reveal a strong relationship between decreases in GFR and increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Even small decreases in GFR increase cardiovascular risk. Serum creatinine may overestimate glomerular filtration. The optimal tests to determine GFR are debated, but calculating GFR from the recent modifications of the Cockcroft and Gault equations is useful. The presence of albuminuria, including microalbuminuria, even in the setting of normal GFR, is also associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk. Urinary albumin excretion should be quantitated and monitored on an annual basis in high-risk groups, such as those with diabetes or renal disease.\nAdditionally, three emerging risk factors-(1) highsensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), a marker of inflammation; (2) homocysteine; and (3) elevated heart rate-may be considered in some individuals, particularly those with CVD but without other risk factor abnormalities. Results of an analysis of the Framingham Heart Study cohort demonstrated that those with an LDL value within the range associated with low CV risk, who also had an elevated HS-CRP value, had a higher CV event rate as compared with those with low CRP and high LDL-C. Other studies also have shown that elevated CRP is associated with a higher CV event rate, especially in women. Elevations in homocysteine have also been described as associated with higher CV risk; however, the results with this marker are not as robust as those with high HS-CRP.", "heading": "Laboratory Tests and Other Diagnostic Procedures"}, {"text": "Additional diagnostic procedures may be indicated to identify causes of hypertension, particularly in patients whose (1) age, history, physical examination, severity of hypertension, or initial laboratory findings suggest such causes; (2) BP responds poorly to drug therapy; (3) BP begins to increase for uncertain reason after being well controlled; and (4) onset of hypertension is sudden. Screening tests for particular forms of identifiable hypertension are shown in Table .\nPheochromocytoma should be suspected in patients with labile hypertension or with paroxysms of hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pallor, and perspiration. Decreased pressure in the lower extremities or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses may indicate aortic coarctation; truncal obesity, glucose intolerance, and purple striae suggest Cushing syndrome. Examples of clues from the laboratory tests include unprovoked hypokalemia (primary aldosteronism), hypercalcemia (hyperparathyroidism), and elevated creatinine or abnormal urinalysis (renal parenchymal disease). Appropriate investigations should be conducted when there is a high index of suspicion of an identifiable cause. The most common parenchymal kidney diseases associated with hypertension are chronic glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. These can generally be distinguished by the clinical setting and additional testing. For example, a renal ultrasound is useful in diagnosing polycystic kidney disease. Renal artery stenosis\nTABLE 8.

Weight loss of as little as 10 lbs (4.5 kg) reduces BP and/or prevents hypertension in a large proportion of overweight persons, although the ideal is to maintain normal body weight. BP is also benefited by adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which is a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lowfat dairy products with a reduced content of dietary cholesterol as well as saturated and total fat (modification of whole diet). It is rich in potassium and calcium content. Dietary sodium should be reduced to no more than 100 mmol per day (2.4 g of sodium). Everyone who is able should engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking at least 30 minutes per day most days of the week. Alcohol intake should be limited to no more than 1 oz (30 mL) of ethanol, the equivalent of two drinks, per day in most men and no more than 0.5 oz of ethanol (one drink) per day in women and lighter weight persons. A drink is 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, and 1.5 oz of 80-proof liquor (Table ). Lifestyle modifications reduce BP, prevent or delay the incidence of hypertension, enhance antihypertensive drug efficacy, and decrease cardiovascular risk.

In hypertensive patients with lower BP goals or with substantially elevated BP, 3 or more antihypertensive drugs may be required.\nSince the first VA Cooperative trial published in 1967, thiazide-type diuretics have been the basis of antihypertensive therapy in the majority of placebo-controlled outcome trials in which CVD events, including strokes, CHD, and HF, have been reduced by BP lowering. However, there are also excellent clinical trial data proving that lowering BP with other classes of drugs, including ACEIs, ARBs, \u2424-blockers (BBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), also reduces the complications of hypertension. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated reduction in CVD with BBs, but the benefits are less consistent than with diuretics. The European Trial on Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (Syst-EUR) study showed significant reductions in stroke and all CVD with the dihydropyridine CCB, nitrendipine, compared with placebo. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, which was not restricted to hypertensive individuals but which included a sizable hypertensive subgroup, showed reductions in a variety of CVD events with the ACEI ramipril compared with placebo in individuals with prior CVD or diabetes mellitus combined with other risk factor(s). The European trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril in stable coronary artery disease (EUROPA), in which the ACEI perindopril was added to existent therapy in patients with stable coronary disease and without HF, also demonstrated reduction in CVD events with ACEIs. Since 1998, several large trials comparing newer classes of agents, including CCBs, ACEIs, an \u2423 1 receptor blocker, and an ARB, with the older diuretics and/or BBs have been completed. Most of these studies showed the newer classes were neither superior nor inferior to the older ones. One exception was the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, in which CVD events were 13% lower (because of differences in stroke but not CHD rates) with the ARB losartan than with the BB atenolol. There has not been a large outcome trial completed as yet comparing an ARB with a diuretic. All of these trials taken together suggest broadly similar cardiovascular protection from BP-lowering with ACEIs, CCBs, and ARBs, as with thiazide-type diuretics and BBs, although some specific outcomes may differ between the classes.

Stroke incidence was greater with lisinopril than chlorthalidone therapy, but these differences were present primarily in blacks, who also had less BP lowering with lisinopril than diuretics. The incidence of HF was greater in CCB-treated and ACEI-treated individuals compared with those receiving the diuretic in both blacks and whites. In the Second Australian National Blood Pressure (ANBP 2 ) study, which compared the effects of an ACEI-based regimen against diuretics-based therapy in 6000 white hypertensive individuals, cardiovascular outcomes were less in the ACEI group, with the favorable effect apparent only in men. CVD outcome data comparing ARB with other agents are limited.\nClinical trial data indicate that diuretics are generally well tolerated. The doses of thiazide-type diuretics used in successful morbidity trials of low-dose diuretics were generally the equivalent of 25 to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or 12.5 to 25 mg of chlorthalidone, although therapy may be initiated at lower doses and titrated to these doses if tolerated. Higher doses have been shown to add little additional antihypertensive efficacy but are associated with more hypokalemia and other adverse effects. Uric acid will increase in many patients receiving a diuretic, but the occurrence of gout is uncommon with dosages \u054550 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide or \u054525 mg of chlorthalidone. Some reports have described an increased degree of sexual dysfunction when thiazide diuretics, particularly at high doses, are used.

Adverse metabolic effects may occur with diuretics. In ALLHAT, diabetes incidence after 4 years of therapy was 11.8% with chlorthalidone therapy, 9.6% with amlodipine, and 8.1% with lisinopril. However, those differences did not translate to fewer CV events for the ACEI or CCB groups. Those who were already diabetic had fewer CV events in the diuretic group than with ACEI treatment. Trials longer than 1 year duration using modest doses of diuretics generally have not shown an increase in serum cholesterol in diuretictreated patients. In ALLHAT, serum cholesterol did not increase from baseline in any group, but it was 1.6 mg/dL lower in the CCB group and 2.2 mg/dL lower in the ACEI group than in diuretic-treated patients. Thiazideinduced hypokalemia could contribute to increased ventricular ectopy and possible sudden death, particularly with high doses of thiazides in the absence of a potassiumsparing agent. In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial, the positive benefits of diuretic therapy were not apparent when serum potassium levels were below 3.5 mmol/L. 126 However, other studies\nTABLE 11.

Despite potential adverse metabolic effects of diuretics, with laboratory monitoring, thiazide-type diuretics are effective and relatively safe for the management of hypertension. Thiazide diuretics are less expensive than other antihypertensive drugs, although as members of other classes of drugs have become available in generic form, their cost has been reduced. Despite the various benefits of diuretics, they remain underutilized. 128", "heading": "2-4 mm Hg 99"}, {"text": "The algorithm for the treatment of hypertensive patients is shown in Figure . Therapy begins with lifestyle modification, and if the BP goal is not achieved, thiazide-type diuretics should be used as initial therapy for most patients, either alone or in combination with one of the other classes (ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, CCBs) that have also been shown to reduce one or more hypertensive complications in randomized controlled outcome trials. Selection of one of these other agents as initial therapy is recommended when a diuretic cannot be used or when a compelling indication is present that requires the use of a specific drug, as listed in Table . If the initial drug selected is not tolerated or is contraindicated, then a drug from one of the other classes proven to reduce cardiovascular events should be substituted.\nSince most hypertensive patients will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve their BP goals, addition of a second drug from a different class should be initiated when use of a single agent in adequate doses fails to achieve the goal. When BP is more than 20 mm Hg above systolic goal or 10 mm Hg above diastolic goal, consideration should be given to initiate therapy with 2 drugs, either as separate prescriptions or in fixed-dose combinations (Figure ). The initiation of therapy with more than one drug increases the likelihood of achieving BP goal in a more timely fashion. The use of multidrug combinations often produces greater BP reduction at lower doses of the component agents, resulting in fewer side effects. The use of fixed-dose combinations may be more convenient and simplify the treatment regimen and may cost less TABLE 12.

Comorbidities such as HF, associated diseases such as diabetes, and the need for laboratory tests influence the frequency of visits.

Therapeutic decisions in such individuals should be directed at both the compelling indication and BP lowering.\nThe absence of a positive indication can signify a lack of information for a particular drug class. For example, in recurrent stroke, there is no study employing CCBs or ARBs. Different stages of the conditions may dictate different strategies. In HF management, thiazide-type diuretics are recommended for reducing the incidence of HF but not in lengthening survival in individuals who already have the condition. Furthermore, widespread use of combination therapy in clinical trials confounds interpretation of the effects of single drugs.

Myocardial oxygen supply in hypertensives may be limited by coronary artery disease (CAD) while myocardial oxygen demand is often greater because of the increased impedance to left ventricular ejection and the frequent presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Lowering both SBP and DBP reduces ischemia and prevents CVD events in patients with CAD, in part by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. One caveat with respect to antihypertensive treatment in patients with CAD is the finding in some studies of an apparent increase in coronary risk at low levels of DBP. For example, in the SHEP study, lowering DBP to \u03fd55 or 60 mm Hg was associated with an increase in cardiovascular events, including MI. No similar increase in coronary events (a J-shaped curve) has been observed with SBP. Patients with occlusive CAD and/or LVH are put at risk of coronary events if DBP is low. Overall, however, many more events are prevented than caused if BP is aggressively treated.", "heading": "Ischemic Heart Disease"}, {"text": "Therapy is directed toward preventing MI and death and reducing symptoms of angina and the occurrence of ischemia. Unless contraindicated, pharmacological therapy should be initiated with a BB. BBs will lower BP, reduce symptoms of angina, improve mortality, and reduce cardiac output, heart rate, and AV conduction. The reduced inotropy and heart rate decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Treatment should also include smoking cessation, management of diabetes, lipid lowering, antiplatelet agents, exercise training, and weight reduction in obese patients.\nIf angina and BP are not controlled by BB therapy alone, or if BBs are contraindicated, as in the presence of severe reactive airway disease, severe peripheral arterial disease, high-degree AV block, or the sick sinus syndrome, either long-acting, dihydropyridine or nondihydropyridine-type CCBs may be used. CCBs decrease total peripheral resistance, which leads to reduction in BP and in wall tension. CCBs also decrease coronary resistance and enhance poststenotic coronary perfusion. Nondihydropyridine CCBs also can decrease heart rate, but when in combination with a BB, they may cause severe bradycardia or high degrees of heart block. Therefore, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs are preferred for combination therapy with BBs. If angina or BP is still not controlled on this two-drug regimen, nitrates can be added, but these should be used with caution in patients taking phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil.

Forty to 50% of patients with symptoms of HF may have preserved systolic function. These patients are more likely to have hypertension, LVH, and isolated diastolic dysfunction and are more likely to be women. A variety of neurohormonal systems, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems may be activated in response to the LV dysfunction, but such activation may lead to abnormal ventricular remodeling, further LV enlargement, and reduced cardiac contractility. The inexorable progression to more severe stages of LV dysfunction can be significantly reduced by effective therapy with ACEIs, BBs, and diuretics.\nHypertension precedes the development of HF in approximately 90% of patients and increases risk for HF by 2-to 3-fold. Hypertension is especially important in HF affecting African Americans and the elderly. CAD is the cause of HF in approximately two-thirds of HF patients in the United States. The true incidence of HF has been unchanged in men and has declined among women during the past 50 years. However, HF hospitalization rates have more than doubled in the past 20 years 159 because of the improved therapy resulting in increased life expectancy. HF will probably become even more prevalent in the future as our population ages.\nOptimal therapy for HF may require the use of specialized HF disease management programs and utilization of a variety of health professionals to reinforce treatment recommendations. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines are available to manage HF. In the stage A group (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I), those at high risk for HF but no demonstrable clinical symptoms or LV dysfunction, treatment should include fastidious risk factor management to control BP, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. ACEIs may be appropriate because of their beneficial effects on mortality in patients at high risk for CVD. The ALLHAT study also has suggested that thiazide-diuretic therapy is useful in preventing disease progression. In stage B HF (NYHA class I) as defined by the presence of reduced LV function (ejection fraction [EF] \u054540%) in otherwise asymptomatic individuals, ACEIs and BBs are recommended. Stage C patients (NYHA class II-III) manifest LV dysfunction and overt symptoms, and in these individuals, ACEIs and BBs are again indicated. Aldosterone antagonists also may be of value in this situation. Loop diuretics are often necessary to control volume retention. However, there is no evidence that diuretics prevent progression of disease, and diuretics can also increase serum creatinine levels when used in excess. Patients with stage D (NYHA class IV) HF may require advanced care, such as inotropic drugs, implantable defibrillators, biventricular pacemakers, mechanical-assist devices, or transplantation, in addition to the treatment described above for stage C patients.\nHF is a \"compelling indication\" for the use of ACEIs. Abundant evidence exists to justify their use with all stages of HF (Table ). In patients intolerant of ACEIs, ARBs may be used. BBs are also recommended in HF because of clinical studies demonstrating decreased morbidity and mortality and improvement in HF symptoms (Table ).\nAldosterone antagonists may provide additional benefit in patients with severe LV dysfunction, usually late stage C (NYHA class III-IV). In the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), low-dose spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg daily), when added to standard therapy, decreased mor-tality by 34%. In the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHE-SUS), eplerenone reduced mortality by 15% in patients following a recent MI with LVEF \u054540%, 90% of whom had HF symptoms. Hyperkalemia is a risk with aldosterone antagonists, even at low doses (especially since most patients also are taking ACEIs or ARBs), but its incidence can be reduced by limiting therapy to patients with serum creatinine \u03fd2.5 mg/dL and monitoring serum potassium carefully.\nBP targets in HF have not been firmly established, but lowering SBP is almost uniformly beneficial. In most successful trials, systolic blood pressures were lowered to the range of 110 to 130 mm Hg. One trial demonstrated benefits of \u2424-blockade in patients with SBP \u03fe85 mm Hg, suggesting that very low BPs (eg, SBP \u03fd100 mm Hg) may be desirable in some HF patients.\nDigoxin continues to be used in HF despite inconsistent clinical results. In the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, it did not reduce mortality in NYHA class II-III patients taking ACEIs and diuretics but did reduce HF symptoms and hospitalizations.", "heading": "Heart Failure"}, {"text": "The combined unadjusted prevalence of total diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in those over 20 years old is 14.4% and is the leading cause of blindness, ESRD, and nontraumatic amputations. Type 2 diabetes constitutes over 90% of diabetes in the United States and is associated with a 70% to 80% chance of premature death from CVD and stroke. The concordance of hypertension and diabetes is increased in the population; hypertension is disproportionately higher in diabetics, 171 while persons with elevated BP are 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes within 5 years. The common absence of normal nocturnal \"dipping\" of BP in diabetics is linked to other CVD surrogates such as LVH and microalbuminuria. The coexistence of hypertension in diabetes is particularly pernicious because of the strong linkage of the 2 conditions with all CVD, 168,169 stroke, progression of renal disease, and diabetic retinopathy. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 174 demonstrated that each 10 mm Hg decrease in SBP was associated with average reductions in rates of diabetes-related mortality of 15%; myocardial infarction, 11%; and the microvascular complications of retinopathy or nephropathy, 13%. Randomized controlled trials that have included large diabetic populations, including UKPDS, Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Trial, SHEP, Syst-EUR, Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study (LIFE), and ALLHAT, have demonstrated that adequate BP control improves CVD outcomes, especially stroke, when aggressive BP targets are achieved. Microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/d) is associated with increased CVD risk in diabetics and other high-risk patients. Overt albuminuria (\u03fe300 mg/d or \u03fe200 mg/g creatinine on spot urine) or renal insufficiency (estimated GFR \u03fd60 mL/min, corresponding to serum creatinine \u03fe1.5 in men or \u03fe1.3 mg/dL in women) defines the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diabetic patients. SBP correlates better than DBP with renal disease progression in diabetics. The rate of decline in renal function among patients with diabetic nephropathy has been reported to be a continuous function of arterial pressure down to approximately 125 to 130 mm Hg SBP and 70 to 75 mm Hg DBP. The JNC 7 recommendations are consistent with guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which has also recommended that BP in diabetics be controlled to levels of 130/80 mm Hg or lower (although available data are somewhat sparse to justify the low target level of 130/ 80 mm Hg). Whatever the goal level, rigorous control of BP is paramount for reducing the progression of diabetic nephropathy to ESRD. Regarding the selection of medications, clinical trials with diuretics, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs, and calcium antagonists have demonstrated benefit in the treatment of hypertension in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics. The question of which agent class is superior for lowering BP is somewhat moot because the majority of diabetic patients will require 2 or more drugs to achieve BP control. Thiazide-type diuretics are beneficial in diabetics, either alone or as part of a combined regimen. In the prespecified diabetic subgroup of ALLHAT, therapy that began with chlorthalidone reduced the primary end point of fatal CHD and MI to the same degree as therapy based on lisinopril or amlodipine. Of potential concern is the tendency for thiazidetype diuretics to worsen hyperglycemia, but this effect tended to be small and did not produce more CV events compared with the other drug classes. Therapy with an ACEI also is an important component of most regimens to control BP in diabetic patients. ACEIs may be used alone for BP lowering but are much more effective when combined with a thiazide-type diuretic or other antihypertensive drugs. The ADA has recommended ACEIs for diabetic patients over 55 years old at high risk for CVD and BBs for those with known CAD. In the Micro-Hope subanalysis of the HOPE Study, which included both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, 186 high-risk diabetic patients treated with ACEI added to conventional therapy showed a reduction in combined MI, stroke, and CVD death of about 25% and reduction in stroke by about 33% compared with placebo plus conventional therapy. With respect to microvascular complications, the ADA has recommended both ACEIs and ARBs for use in Type 2 diabetic patients with CKD because these agents delay the deterioration in GFR and the worsening of albuminuria. BBs, especially \u2424 1 -selective agents, are beneficial in dia-betics as part of multidrug therapy, but their value as monotherapy is less clear. A BB is indicated in a diabetic with ischemic heart disease but may be less effective in preventing stroke than an ARB, as was found in the LIFE study. Although BBs can cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis in diabetics, including worsening of insulin sensitivity and potential masking of the epinephrine-mediated symptoms of hypoglycemia, these problems are usually easily managed and are not absolute contraindications for BB use.\nCalcium channel blockers may be useful in diabetics, particularly as part of combination therapy to control BP. They were shown to reduce CVD events in diabetics compared with placebo in several clinical outcome trials. In the diabetic cohort of ALLHAT, amlodipine was as effective as chlorthalidone in all categories except HF, where it was significantly inferior. The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) study in diabetics was stopped prematurely when it was found that the dihydropyridine nitrendipine was inferior to lisinopril in reducing the incidence of ischemic cardiac events. 188 However, in normotensive diabetics in the Second ABCD (ABCD 2 ) study, nitrendipine was equivalent to lisinopril in stroke prevention and in retardation of the development of albuminuria. 189", "heading": "Diabetes and Hypertension"}, {"text": "Age and Kidney Function Renal excretory function, as represented by GFR, deteriorates with age beginning in the third or fourth decade of life. By the sixth decade, GFR commonly declines by 1 to 2 mL/min per year. This age-related loss of renal function is proportional to BP level, and the rate of GFR deterioration can accelerate to 4 to 8 mL/min per year if SBP remains uncontrolled. Such rates of deterioration may lead to the development of ESRD and the need for dialysis or transplantation, especially in those with other coexistent renal disease.\nCKD is defined as either ( ) reduced excretory function with an eGFR \u03fd60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (approximately corresponding to a creatinine of \u03fe1.5 mg/dL in men or \u03fe1.3 mg/dL in women) or (2) the presence of albuminuria (\u03fe300 mg/d or 200 mg/g creatinine). In a number of laboratories, serum creatinine is being replaced as an index of renal function by eGFR, the values of which are derived from newer algorithms that include adjustments for gender, race, and age. These algorithms are available on web sites. The measurements appear to be of greater value than 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance.\nUrinary albumin excretion has diagnostic and prognostic value equivalent to reduced eGFR. To avoid inaccuracies associated with 24-hour urine collections, spot urine samples may be used and the ACR determined. Microalbuminuria is present when the spot urine ACR is between 30 and 200 mg albumin/g creatinine.

Individuals with eGFR \u03fd60 mL/min have an approximate 16% increase in CVD mortality, and individuals with eGFR \u03fd30 mL/min, a 30% increase. CVD risk also exhibits a continuous relationship with albuminuria; the presence of microalbuminuria confers a 50% increase in risk and the presence of macroalbuminuria, a 350% increase. Therapy NHANES III data indicated that about 3% (5.6 million people) of adults in the United States had elevated serum creatinine values and 70% of these had hypertension. While 75% of individuals received treatment, only 11% with hypertension and elevated serum creatinine had BP \u03fd130/ 85 mm Hg and only 27% had BP \u03fd140/90 mm Hg. In the prevention of CKD, the value of vigorous antihypertensive therapy is most pronounced in those individuals with the greatest degrees of albuminuria. In the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) study, individuals with proteinuria had slower rates of progression to ESRD if their SBP values were \u03fd130 mm Hg. A meta-analysis of individuals with CKD and albuminuria found that positive predictors of outcome were lower SBP levels (110 to 129 mm Hg), lower albumin excretion ratio (AER) (\u03fd1.0 g/d), and the presence of ACEI therapy. However, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) study of African American individuals with hypertensive CKD, those achieving a mean BP of 128/78 mm Hg experienced renal deterioration at the same rate as those achieving a mean of 141/85 mm Hg. Many studies demonstrate that antihypertensive regimens that include an ACEI or ARB are more effective in slowing progression of CKD than other antihypertensive regimens. The joint recommendations of the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) provide useful guidelines for management of hypertensive patients with CKD. They recommend a goal BP for all CKD patients of \u03fd130/80 mm Hg and a need for more than 1 antihypertensive drug to achieve this goal. The guidelines indicate that most patients with CKD should receive an ACEI or an ARB in combination with a diuretic and that many will require a loop diuretic rather than a thiazide. In addition, if there is a conflict between the goals of slowing progression of CKD and CVD risk reduction, individual decision-making is recommended, based on risk stratification.", "heading": "CVD Risk in CKD"}, {"text": "The risk of clinical complications of cerebrovascular disease including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and dementia increases as a function of BP levels. Given the population distribution of BP, most ischemic strokes occur in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. The incidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is reduced substantially by treatment of hypertension. No specific agent has proven to be clearly superior to all others for stroke protection. In the LIFE study, there were fewer strokes in the losartan-treated group than in the group treated with atenolol. In the ALLHAT study, the stroke incidence was 15% greater with ACEI than with thiazide-type diuretic or dihydropyridine CCB, but the BP reduction in the lisinopril group was also less than with chlorthalidone or amlodipine. With respect to the prevention of recurrent stroke, PROGRESS demonstrated that addition of the diuretic indapamide to the ACEI perindopril caused a 43% reduction in stroke occurrence. The reduced incidence of stroke appeared related to the BP reduction obtained by the combination therapy even though many patients on entry into the study were not hypertensive. No significant reduction was present in those on perindopril alone whose BP was only 5/3 mm Hg lower than in the control group.\nThe management of BP during an acute stroke remains controversial. BP is often elevated in the immediate post-stroke period and is thought by some to be a compensatory physiological response to improve cerebral perfusion to ischemic brain tissue. As a result, it has been common practice after acute cerebral infarction to reduce or withhold BP treatment until the clinical condition has stabilized. There still are no large clinical studies on which to base definitive recommendations. Nevertheless, the American Stroke Association has provided the following guidelines: In patients with recent ischemic stroke whose SBP is \u03fe220 mm Hg or DBP 120 to 140 mm Hg, cautious reduction of BP by about 10% to 15% is suggested, while carefully monitoring the patient for neurological deterioration related to the lower pressure. If the DBP is \u03fe140 mm Hg, carefully monitored infusion of sodium nitroprusside should be used to reduce the BP by 10 to 15%. BP control affects the use of thrombolytic agents in ischemic stroke. SBP \u03fe185 mm Hg or diastolic pressures \u03fe110 mm Hg are contraindications to the use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within the first 3 hours of an ischemic stroke. Once a thrombolytic agent has been initiated, BP should be monitored closely, especially in the first 24 hours after initiation of treatment. SBP \u0546180 mm Hg or DBP \u0546105 mm Hg usually necessitates therapy with intravenous agents to prevent intracerebral bleeding. 199", "heading": "Patients with Cerebrovascular Disease"}, {"text": null, "heading": "Other Special Situations"}, {"text": "The prevalence, impact, and control of hypertension differ across racial and ethnic subgroups of the US population. In African Americans, hypertension is more common, more severe, develops at an earlier age, and leads to more clinical sequelae than in age-matched non-Hispanic whites. Mexican Americans and Native Americans have lower control rates than non-Hispanic whites and African Americans. The pathogenesis of hypertension in different racial subgroups may differ with respect to the contributions of such factors as salt, potassium, stress, cardiovascular reactivity, body weight, nephron number, sodium handling, or hormonal systems, but in all subgroups, the pathogenesis is multifactorial. African Americans have a greater prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, especially obesity. Much of the variance in hypertension-related sequelae across racial or ethnic groups may be attributable to differences in socioeconomic conditions, access to healthcare services, or attitudes, beliefs, and deficits in accurate health-related information. For example, when medications and provider services were provided free of charge as in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, African American men treated with the intensive \"Stepped-Care Approach\" actually benefited more than whites. Weight reduction and sodium reduction are recommended for all prehypertensive and hypertensive patients but may be particularly effective in minorities. The salt content of some traditional diets in minorities may be very high. The low-sodium DASH eating plan was associated with greater reductions in BP in African Americans than other demographic subgroups. In clinical trials, lowering BP prevents sequelae of hypertension in all racial or ethnic groups. Nonetheless, monotherapy with BBs, ACEIs, or ARBs lowers BP to a somewhat lesser degree in African Americans than whites. In the ALLHAT trial with more than 15 000 blacks, the ACEIs were less effective in lowering blood pressure than either the thiazide-type diuretic or the CCBs. This was associated with a 40% greater risk of stroke, 32% greater risk of HF, and 19% greater risk of CVD in those randomized to the ACEI versus the diuretic. The interracial differences in BP-lowering observed with these drugs are abolished when they are combined with a diuretic. Racial differences in incidence of antihypertensive drug side effects may occur; African Americans and Asians have a 3-to 4-fold higher risk of angioedema and have more cough attributed to ACEIs than whites. Several other benefits of treatment have been demonstrated in minority populations. A 28% reduction in mortality was observed in African Americans who received BB therapy after acute myocardial infarction compared with those not receiving a BB. A greater degree of preservation of renal function occurred in African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis treated with a regimen containing an ACEI compared with BB or a calcium antagonist. No large outcome studies have been carried out with ARBs in African American and other minority patients. Unfortunately, sufficient numbers of Mexican Americans, other Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, or Asian/Pacific Islanders have not been included in most of the major clinical trials to allow reaching strong conclusions about their responses to individual antihypertensive therapies.\nIrrespective of whether race or ethnicity should be a significant consideration in the choice of individual antihypertensive drugs, the use of combination or multiple antihypertensive drug therapy, which usually includes a thiazidetype diuretic, in minority groups will lower BP and reduce the burden of hypertension-related cardiovascular and renal disease.", "heading": "Minorities"}, {"text": null, "heading": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"text": "The term \"metabolic syndrome\" describes a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors related to hypertension, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.

This challenging task will require a complex combination of healthy behaviors, including decrease in sedentary activities, increase in physical activity, and reduction in calorie intake (Table ). Simple yet practical suggestions include reducing time spent watching television or being online and increasing time spent walking or in activities that raise heart rate. The emphasis for weight management should be on avoidance of excess total energy intake and a regular pattern of physical activity. Reducing food portion sizes and limiting fat intake can assist in reducing overall calorie intake. High-sodium diets may be especially deleterious in obese subjects. Specific nutrient intakes for individuals should be based on lipoprotein levels, BP, and the presence of coexisting heart disease, diabetes, and other risk factors. For example, adoption of the well-studied low-sodium DASH eating plan provides heart-healthy foods that can be used to promote weight loss, reduce BP in both hypertensive and prehypertensive individuals, and reduce LDL. The benefits of modest lifestyle changes on cardiovascular risk factors are well documented. In the Framingham Heart Study, weight loss of 5 pounds or greater was associated with reductions in cardiovascular risk of about 40%. A 10% reduction in body weight can reduce disease risk factors. Physical activity is a key feature of treatment. Increased physical activity, when combined with a reduction in calories, is essential to weight loss success. Based on the available evidence, the recommendation is to engage in regular physical activity at least 30 minutes per day, most days of the week (see Table ). In addition, physical activity is critical to the maintenance of weight loss and is important for overall reduction in cardiovascular risk; 60 to 90 minutes per week of walking can reduce CHD mortality by about 50%.

Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease is associated with a greatly increased risk of death from CVD, in part because diffuse atherosclerosis, CAD, and renovascular disease frequently coexist in these patients. Therefore, more intensive screening for these related cardiovascular disorders is appropriate in persons with PAD. Renovascular hypertension should be strongly considered in this population if BP is uncontrolled and if ACEI or ARB treatment is being considered.\nAntihypertensive drug treatment is ineffective in relieving the symptoms of PAD, and vasodilator agents such as ACEIs, CCBs, \u2423-adrenergic blockers, and direct vasodilators do not improve walking distance or symptoms of claudication. This lack of efficacy may be due to inability of maximally dilated diseased vessels to dilate further during exercise, redistribution of flow caused by the creation of a \"steal\" phenomenon where blood flow increases in nondiseased vascular beds at the expense of diseased beds, or alteration of pressure-flow relationships distal to the occluded areas by BP reduction. BBs may cause peripheral vasoconstriction and have the potential to increase the frequency of intermittent claudication in individuals with PAD. However, recent studies have shown that BBs have little effect on walking distance or calf blood flow in patients with intermittent claudication. Thus, BBs can be used in PAD patients, especially if needed for treatment of CAD or HF.\nNo selective outcome benefit has been demonstrated for any individual class of antihypertensive medication in patients with PAD. Therefore, antihypertensive drug choices should be made on the basis of the presence or absence of compelling indications. If Raynaud's phenomenon is present, CCBs can be used. 251 LDL lowering will reduce the risk for CVD events in people with PAD. Therapy Treating hypertension in PAD patients reduces the risk of MI, stroke, HF, and death. A structured walking program has been shown to increase the pain-free and maximum walking distances in patients with intermittent claudication. Smoking cessation may be the most important factor in whether PAD progresses. Patients should be encouraged and assisted to stop smoking.

SBP increases almost linearly with age in industrialized societies (Figure ), as does the overall prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of hypertensives with isolated SBP elevation (ISH) (Figure ). In contrast, DBP increases in parallel with SBP until about age 55, after which it declines as a manifestation of age-related increases in central arterial stiffness. By age 60, about two-thirds of those with hypertension have ISH, and by age 75, almost all hypertensives have systolic hypertension and about three-fourths of hypertensives have ISH.\nIndividuals over age 60 represent the most rapidly growing segment of the US population, and even in those who remain normotensive between 55 and 65 years old, there remains a lifetime risk of developing hypertension that exceeds 90%. At the same time, there is a 3-to 4-fold increase in CVD risk in older compared with younger individuals. These facts prompted the NHBPEP to issue a Clinical Advisory statement in May, 2000, stating that SBP should be the primary target for the diagnosis and management of older people with hypertension. Currently, BP control rates (systolic \u03fd140 mm Hg and diastolic \u03fd90 mm Hg) are only about 20% in older hypertensives, largely due to poor control of SBP. 257", "heading": "Hypertension in Older People"}, {"text": "In the SHEP study involving hypertensives over 60 years old with pretreatment SBP \u03fe160 and DBP \u03fd90 mm Hg, individuals treated with chlorthalidone (with or without BB) had reductions in the primary end point of stroke (36%), as well as HF events (54%), myocardial infarctions (27%), and overall CVD (32%) as compared with the placebo group. Using a similar design and sample size, the Syst-EUR study compared a regimen based on nitrendipine to placebo and found a significant reduction in stroke (41%) as well as overall CVD events (31%). A meta-analysis of 8 placebocontrolled trials in 15 693 elderly patients followed for 4 years found that active antihypertensive treatment reduced coronary events (23%), strokes (30%), cardiovascular deaths (18%), and total deaths (13%), with the benefit particularly great in those older than 70 years. Benefits of therapy have been demonstrated even in individuals over 80 years old. Analyses of treatment trials in the elderly by the Hypertension Trialists group have suggested that the choice of initial agent is less important than the degree of BP reduction achieved. Accurate and representative BP measurement can pose special problems in some older individuals (see the section Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement in the Office). BP is more variable in the older patient, often due to stiff large arteries and age-related decreases in baroreflex buffering. Exaggerated BP drops may occur in the elderly during postural change (see the section Orthostatic Hypotension), after meals, 260 and after exercise. Pseudohypertension, where cuff BP overestimates the actual intra-arterial pressure due to relative inability of the BP cuff to compress a thickened, stiff, or calcified brachial artery, is an uncommon condition in older persons. But this condition should be strongly considered if usual treatment does not reduce BP, especially in those patients who complain of symptoms consistent with postural hypotension. A relatively small percentage of elderly patients have a reversible form of hypertension, most commonly due to renovascular disease, which is seen most often in smokers. SBP provides more appropriate classification and risk stratification than DBP in the elderly. In the Framingham Heart Study, SBP alone correctly classified the BP stage in 94% of adults over 60 years old, while DBP alone correctly classified 66%. Pulse pressure (PP) (SBP \u03ea DBP) is only marginally stronger than SBP for risk stratification in individuals over age 60, but under age 60, PP is not useful as a CVD risk predictor. PP generally decreases as a result of SBP lowering, but no prospective clinical trial has used PP as the primary clinical end point. Thus, on balance, SBP is superior to PP and DBP as a way to stratify patients and as a target for treatment in older persons.\nAlthough there is no randomized prospective clinical trial that has conclusively proven the benefits of treatment in individuals with Stage 1 systolic hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg), hypertension therapy should not be withheld in these patients, and therapy should not be withheld on the basis of age.

When weight loss was combined with salt reduction, an additional BP decrease was seen. Older persons should also be encouraged to avoid excessive alcohol intake and remain as physically active as feasible.\nUse of specific drug classes in older people is largely similar to that recommended in the general algorithm and for individual compelling indications. Combination therapy with two or more drugs is generally needed to achieve optimal BP control. In routine practice, if the systolic goal is achieved, the diastolic goal will almost always be reached as well.\nA significant number of elderly individuals have widely variable BP with exaggerated high and low extremes. Such individuals deserve consideration for a slow titration approach, as do individuals with a history of medication side effects and those with orthostatic hypotension. Unfortunately, the misperception that many elderly have \"brittle hypertension\" has contributed to widespread inadequacy of drug titration and to poor BP control.", "heading": "Treatment Benefits"}, {"text": "BP measurements are typically recorded in the sitting position. This practice, while convenient for the practitioner, limits the ability to diagnose orthostatic hypotension (OH). Normally, standing is accompanied by a small increase in DBP and a small decrease in SBP when compared with supine values. OH is present when there is a supine-tostanding BP decrease \u03fe20 mm Hg systolic or \u03fe10 mm Hg diastolic. There is more OH in diabetics. OH occurred in about 7% of men over 70 years old in the Honolulu Heart Study, was highly age-dependent, and carried with it a 64% increase in age-adjusted mortality compared with a control population. There is a strong correlation between the severity of OH and premature death as well as increased numbers of falls and fractures. The causes of OH include severe volume depletion, baroreflex dysfunction, autonomic insufficiency, and certain venodilator antihypertensive drugs, especially \u2423-blockers and \u2423-\u2424-blockers. Diuretics and nitrates may further aggravate OH.\nIn treating older hypertensive patients, clinicians should be alert to potential OH symptoms such as postural unsteadiness, dizziness, or even fainting. Lying and standing BPs should be obtained periodically in all hypertensive individuals over 50 years old. OH is a common barrier to intensive BP control that should be clearly documented; if present, drug therapy should be adjusted accordingly and appropriate warnings given to patients.", "heading": "Orthostatic Hypotension"}, {"text": "Resistant hypertension is defined as the failure to achieve goal BP in patients who are adhering to full doses of an appropriate 3-drug regimen that includes a diuretic. Several causes of resistant hypertension may be present.\nImproper BP measurement can lead to overestimation of intra-arterial pressure. (See section on BP measurement.) Falsely high readings may also be observed in those whose brachial arteries are heavily calcified or arteriosclerotic and cannot be fully compressed. Clinic or white-coat hyperten-sion may also lead to transient high readings that are not experienced throughout the day. This can be documented by home BP or ambulatory BP readings.\nInadequate diuretic therapy is common in resistant hypertension. Volume overload, once recognized, can be managed by use of appropriate diuretics. While a thiazide-type diuretic is recommended for the majority of hypertensive patients, a loop diuretic is often required for patients who have a decreased GFR or HF.\nFailure to receive adequate medications can be the result of reluctance on the part of the patient or practitioner to use effective doses of medications. Causes and approaches to nonadherence are discussed in subsequent sections of this review.\nDrug interactions that induce resistance may be difficult to detect unless the patient is asked open-ended questions regarding what they take when experiencing pain and what food supplements, health food preparations, and over-thecounter and Internet-purchased medications and supplements they use. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pressor agents in cold remedies, nasal vasodilators, and some nontraditional remedies may counter the antihypertensive effects of prescribed medications.\nIf resistant hypertension persists after remediable causes are identified and corrected, then a concerted search for a cause of secondary hypertension should be conducted (Table ). If resistance still persists, consultation with a hypertension specialist is a logical next step.\nSpecific causes of resistant hypertension are listed in Table . They usually can be identified by appropriate evaluation, and, once identified, can almost always be treated effectively. The prevalence of truly resistant hypertension is small.", "heading": "Resistant Hypertension"}, {"text": "Dementia and cognitive impairment occur more commonly in people with hypertension. Reduced progression of cognitive impairment may occur with effective antihypertensive therapy. Narrowing and sclerosis of small penetrating arteries in the subcortical regions of the brain are common findings on autopsy in chronic hypertension. These changes are believed to contribute to hypoperfusion, loss of autoregulation, compromise of the blood-brain barrier, and ultimately to subcortical white matter demyelination, microinfarction, and cognitive decline. MRI studies in persons with chronic hypertension have revealed greater numbers of subcortical white matter lesions and microinfarcts, astrogliosis, ventricular enlargement, and extracellular fluid accumulation than in agematched controls. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a diagnostic category that represents a transitional state between normal aging and mild dementia in which patients exhibit signs of poor recent memory but can still perform daily tasks such as managing finances, driving, shopping, and preparing meals. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are risk factors for MCI and for other signs of cognitive decline, such as impaired attention, reaction time, verbal fluency, or executive function. Effective antihypertensive therapy strongly reduces the risk of developing significant white matter changes on MRI. 290 However, existing white matter changes, once established, do not appear to be reversible. The optimal SBP/DBP to prevent cognitive decline in older individuals is thought by some to be in the SBP 135 to 150 mm Hg and DBP 70 to 79 mm Hg range. In the SystEUR trial, CCB therapy was superior to placebo in slowing the decline in cognitive function, but no comparative data are available regarding whether certain classes of antihypertensive drugs are superior to others in preventing cognitive decline.", "heading": "Cognitive Function and Dementia"}, {"text": null, "heading": "Hypertension in Women"}, {"text": "Women. There is a sexual dimorphism in BP, such that women have lower SBP levels than men during early adulthood, while the opposite is true after the sixth decade of life. DBP tends to be just marginally lower in women than men regardless of age. Similarly, in early adulthood, hypertension is less common among women than men. However, after the fifth decade of life, the incidence of hypertension increases more rapidly in women than men, and the prevalence of hypertension in women is equal to or exceeds that in men during the sixth decade of life. The highest prevalence rates of hypertension are observed in elderly black women, with hypertension occurring in more than 75% of women older than 75 years. Awareness, Treatment, and Control of High BP in Women. Women are more likely than men to know that they have hypertension, to have it treated, and to have it controlled. In NHANES III, approximately 75% of hypertensive black and white women were aware of their high BP in contrast to just 65% of hypertensive men in these ethnic groups. Overall, 61% of hypertensive women, but only 44% of men, were being treated with antihypertensive medications. The higher treatment rates in women have been attributed to increased numbers of physician contacts.\nMenopause and Blood Pressure. The effect of menopause on BP is controversial. Longitudinal studies have not documented a rise in BP with menopause, while cross-sectional studies have found significantly higher SBP and DBP in postmenopausal versus premenopausal women. In NHANES III, the rate of rise in SBP tended to be steeper in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women until the sixth decade, when the rate of increase tended to slow. Staessen et al 296 reported that even after adjustment for age and BMI, postmenopausal women are more than twice as likely to have hypertension as premenopausal women. In a prospective study of conventional and ambulatory BP levels, postmenopausal women had higher SBP (4 to 5 mm Hg) than pre-and perimenopausal controls. The increase in SBP per decade was 5 mm Hg greater in the peri-and postmenopausal women than in the premenopausal group. Thus, there is evidence that at least part of the rise in BP (particularly SBP) seen later in life in women is due to menopause. A menopause-related increase in BP has been attributed to a variety of factors, including estrogen withdrawal, overproduction of pituitary hormones, weight gain, or a combination of these and other yet undefined neurohumoral influences. Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and BP. Results of studies evaluating the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on BP have been inconsistent. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest longitudinal study to address this question, found an average 1 mm Hg increase in SBP over 5.6 years of follow-up among 8506 postmenopausal women randomized to conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate as compared with a placebo group. There was no difference in DBP between the hormone treatment groups. Further, in the WHI cross-sectional analysis of almost 100 000 women aged 50 to 79 years, current hormone use was associated with a 25% greater likelihood of having hypertension compared with past use or no prior use. Smaller observational and interventional studies have found different results. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), women receiving HRT had a significantly smaller increase in SBP over time than nonusers, but DBP was not affected. The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Intervention trial showed no effect of HRT on SBP or DBP. In small studies that have used 24-hour ambulatory monitoring to evaluate the effects of HRT on BP, while overall results are inconsistent, several of the studies suggest that HRT improves or restores the normal nighttime reduction (\"dipping\") in BP that may be diminished in postmenopausal women. Such an effect would tend to reduce total BP load and thereby reduce target organ damage. Overall, HRT-related change in BP is likely to be modest and should not preclude hormone use in normotensive or hypertensive women. All hypertensive women treated with HRT should have their BP monitored closely at first and then at 6-month intervals.\nTABLE 18. Causes of Resistant Hypertension Improper BP measurement Volume overload Excess sodium intake Volume retention from kidney disease Inadequate diuretic therapy Drug-induced or other causes Nonadherence Inadequate doses Inappropriate combinations Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors Cocaine, amphetamines, other illicit drugs Sympathomimetics (decongestants, anorectics) Oral contraceptive hormones Adrenal steroid hormones Cyclosporine and tacrolimus Erythropoietin Licorice (including some chewing tobacco) Selected over-the-counter dietary supplements and medicines (eg, ephedra, ma haung, bitter orange) Associated conditions Obesity Excess alcohol intake Identifiable causes of hypertension (See Table 7.)\nOral Contraceptives and BP. Many women taking oral contraceptives experience a small but detectable increase in BP; a small percentage experience the onset of frank hypertension. This is true even with modern preparations that contain only 30 g estrogen. The Nurses' Health Study found that current users of oral contraceptives had a significantly increased (relative risk [RR]\u03ed1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u03ed1.5 to 2.3) risk of hypertension compared with never users. Absolute risk was small: only 41.5 cases of hypertension per 10 000 person-years could be attributed to oral contraceptive use. Controlled prospective studies have demonstrated a return of BP to pretreatment levels within 3 months of discontinuing oral contraceptives, indicating that their BP effect is readily reversible.\nOral contraceptives occasionally may precipitate accelerated or malignant hypertension. Family history of hypertension, including preexisting pregnancy-induced hypertension, occult renal disease, obesity, middle age (\u03fe35 years), and duration of oral contraceptive use increase susceptibility to hypertension. Contraceptive-induced hypertension appears to be related to the progestogenic, not the estrogenic, potency of the preparation.\nRegular monitoring of BP throughout contraceptive therapy is recommended, and it has been suggested that contraceptive prescriptions be limited to 6 months to ensure at least semiannual reevaluations. Withdrawal of the offending contraceptive agent is generally desirable in cases of contraceptive-induced hypertension, but such therapy may have to be continued in some women (eg, if other contraceptive methods are not suitable) and combined with antihypertensive therapy.", "heading": "Nonpregnant Women Sexual Dimorphism of BP and Hypertension Prevalence in"}, {"text": "Relative benefits of antihypertensive therapy do not appear to differ between the sexes. Absolute risk reduction for stroke was also similar in men and women, but for coronary events, it was greater in men. Similarly, a placebo-controlled trial of CCB treatment showed treatment benefits for both sexes. More recent outcome trials comparing ACEIs, ARBs, or CCBs with diuretics and BBs in older, high-risk patients have generally shown similar benefits for women and men. The current evidence indicates that the sex of the patient should not play a role in decisions about whether or not to treat high BP.\nChoice of Antihypertensive Drugs for Women. While women generally respond to antihypertensive drugs similarly to men, some special considerations may dictate treatment choices for women. ACEIs and ARBs are contraindicated for women who are or intend to become pregnant because of the risk of fetal developmental abnormalities. Diuretics are particularly useful in elderly individuals because of a decreased risk of hip fracture. Some antihypertensive drugs have gender-specific adverse effect profiles. For example, in the TOMHS study, women reported twice as many adverse effects as men. Women are more likely to develop diuretic-induced hyponatremia, and men more likely to develop gout. Hypokalemia is more common in women taking a diuretic. ACEI-induced cough is twice as common in women as in men, and women are more likely to complain of CCB-related peripheral edema and minoxidil-induced hirsutism.", "heading": "Outcomes of Antihypertensive Trials in Women."}, {"text": "Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are a major cause of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hypertension in pregnancy is classified into 1 of 5 categories (Table ), and it is critical to differentiate preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific syndrome of exaggerated vasoconstriction and reduced organ perfusion, from pre-existing chronic hypertension. Prepregnancy Assessment. Women should be evaluated prior to conception to define their BP status, and, if hypertensive, to assess its severity, possible secondary causes, and presence of target organ damage and to plan treatment strategies. Many hypertensive women who plan to become pregnant should be screened for pheochromocytoma because of the high morbidity and mortality of this condition if not diagnosed antepartum. In hypertensive women planning to become pregnant, it may be prudent prior to conception to change to antihypertensive medications known to be safe during pregnancy, such as methyldopa or BBs. ACEIs and ARBs should be discontinued prior to attempts at conception or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Those with progressive renal diseases should be encouraged to complete their childbearing while their renal function is relatively well preserved. Mild renal disease (serum creatinine \u03fd1.4 mg/dL) has a minimal effect on fetal survival, and the underlying renal disease does not generally worsen during pregnancy. However, moderate or severe renal insufficiency in pregnancy may accelerate both hypertension and the underlying disease and markedly reduce fetal survival.", "heading": "Pregnant Women"}, {"text": "Women with Stage 1 hypertension are at low risk for cardiovascular complications during pregnancy and are candidates for lifestyle modification therapy only, as there is no evidence that pharmacological treatment improves neonatal outcomes. Further, BP usually falls during the first half of pregnancy; therefore, hypertension may be easier to control with reduced or no medications. With lifestyle modification, aerobic exercise should be restricted on the basis of theoretical concerns that inadequate placental blood flow may increase the risk of preeclampsia, and weight reduction should not be attempted, even in obese pregnant women. Although the data on pregnant women are sparse, many experts recommend restriction of sodium intake to the same 2.4 g sodium intake recommended for those with primary hypertension. Use of alcohol and tobacco must be strongly discouraged. Use of antihypertensive drugs in pregnant women with chronic hypertension varies greatly among centers. Some clinicians prefer to stop antihyperten-sive medications while maintaining close observation, including use of home BP monitoring. This approach reflects concern about the safety of antihypertensive drug treatment in pregnancy. A meta-analysis of 45 randomized controlled studies of treatment with several classes of antihypertensive drugs in Stage 1 and 2 hypertension in pregnancy showed a direct linear relationship between treatment-induced fall in mean arterial pressure and the proportion of small-forgestational-age infants. This relationship was independent of type of hypertension, type of antihypertensive agent, and duration of therapy. However, for pregnant women with target organ damage or a prior requirement for multiple antihypertensive agents for BP control, antihypertensive medication should be continued as needed to control BP. In all cases, treatment should be reinstituted once BP reaches 150 to 160 mm Hg systolic or 100 to 110 mm Hg diastolic, in order to prevent increases in BP to very high levels during pregnancy. Aggressive treatment of severe chronic hypertension in the first trimester is critical, since fetal loss rates of 50% and significant maternal mortality have been reported in these patients. Most of the poor outcomes are related to superimposed preeclampsia (Table ). Further, women with chronic hypertension are also at higher risk for adverse neonatal outcomes if proteinuria is present early in pregnancy. Fetal loss and acceleration of maternal renal disease increase at serum creatinine levels \u03fe1.4 mg/dL at conception. Antihypertensive Drug Selection. The primary goal of treating chronic hypertension in pregnancy is to reduce maternal risk, but the choice of antihypertensive agent(s) is largely driven by the safety of the fetus. Methyldopa is preferred by many as first-line therapy, based on reports of stable uteroplacental blood flow and fetal hemodynamics and the absence of long-term (7.5-year follow-up) adverse effects on development of children exposed to methyldopa in utero. Other treatment options are summarized in Table .\nPreeclampsia. Preeclampsia is more common in women with chronic hypertension, with an incidence of approximately 25%. Risk factors for superimposed preeclampsia include\nTABLE 20.

Prevention of preeclampsia relies on identification of high-risk women and close clinical and laboratory monitoring aimed at its early recognition, and institution of intensive monitoring or delivery when indicated. Treatment of preeclampsia includes hospitalization for bed rest, control of BP, seizure prophylaxis in the presence of signs of impending eclampsia, and timely delivery. Importantly, many women with preeclampsia have previously been normotensive, so acute BP elevations even to modest levels (ie, 150/100 mm Hg) may cause significant symptomatology and require treatment. Treatment does not alter the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, but it may slow its progression and provide time for fetal maturation. Preeclampsia rarely remits spontaneously and in most cases worsens with time. While delivery may be appropriate therapy for the mother, it may compromise a fetus of less than 32 weeks gestation. Regardless of gestational age, delivery should be strongly considered when there are signs of fetal distress or intrauterine growth retardation or signs of maternal problems, including severe hypertension, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, deteriorating renal function, visual disturbance, headache, or epigastric pain. Vaginal delivery is preferable to cesarean delivery to avoid the added stress of surgery.\nAntihypertensive Drug Therapy. Antihypertensive therapy should be prescribed only for maternal safety; it does not improve perinatal outcomes and may adversely affect uteroplacental blood flow. Selection of antihypertensive agents and route of administration depends on anticipated timing of delivery. If delivery is likely more than 48 hours off, oral methyldopa is preferred because of its safety record. Oral labetalol is an alternative, and other BBs and calcium antagonists are also acceptable on the basis of limited data (Table ). If delivery is imminent, parenteral agents are practical and effective (Table ). Antihypertensives are administered before induction of labor for persistent DBPs of 105 to 110 mm Hg or higher, aiming for levels of 95 to 105 mm Hg.\nTreating Hypertension During Lactation. Hypertensive mothers can usually breast-feed safely. However, all antihypertensive drugs that have been studied are excreted into human breast milk. Therefore, in mothers with stage 1 hypertension who wish to breast-feed for a few months, it might be prudent to withhold antihypertensive medication, with close monitoring of BP, and reinstitute antihypertensive therapy following discontinuation of nursing. No short-term adverse effects have been reported from exposure to methyldopa or hydralazine. Propanolol and labetalol are preferred if a BB is indicated. ACEIs and ARBs should be avoided on the basis of reports of adverse fetal and neonatal renal effects. Diuretics may reduce milk volume and thereby suppress lactation. Breast-fed infants of mothers taking antihypertensive agents should be closely monitored for potential adverse effects.\nRecurrence of Hypertension. Hypertension recurs in a large proportion (20% to 50%) of subsequent pregnancies. Risk factors for recurrence include early onset of hypertension in the first pregnancy, a history of chronic hypertension, persistent hypertension beyond 5 weeks postpartum, and elevated BP early in pregnancy. Women with preeclampsia have a greater tendency to develop hypertension than those with normotensive pregnancies.", "heading": "Chobanian et al"}, {"text": "In children and adolescents, hypertension is defined as elevated BP that persists on repeated measurement at the 95th percentile or greater for age, height, and gender (Table ). As with adults, the fifth Korotkoff sound is used to define DBP. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of identifiable causes of hypertension in younger children. Secondary forms of hypertension are more common in children and in individuals with severe hypertension (\u03fe20 mm Hg above the 95th percentile). Chronic hypertension is becoming increasingly common in adolescence and is generally associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and a positive family history of hypertension and other CVDs. Like adults, children and adolescents with established hypertension develop target organ damage, including LVH. Appropriate assessment for LVH, including echocardiography, should be considered in children who have significant and persisting hypertension.\nLifestyle interventions should be recommended for all children with hypertension, with pharmacological therapy instituted for higher levels of BP or if insufficient response to lifestyle modifications occurs. Teenage children with BP below but near the 95th percentile should adopt healthy lifestyles similar to adults with prehypertension. Although the recommendations for drug choices are generally similar in", "heading": "Hypertension in Children and Adolescents"}, {"text": "Hypertensive emergencies are characterized by severe elevations in BP (\u03fe180/120 mm Hg) complicated by evidence of impending or progressive target organ dysfunction. They require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal) to prevent or limit target organ damage. Examples include hypertensive encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, or eclampsia. Hypertensive urgencies are those situations associated with severe elevations in BP without progressive target organ dysfunction. Examples include upper levels of stage II hypertension associated with severe headache, shortness of breath, epistaxis, or severe anxiety. The majority of these patients present as noncompliant or inadequately treated hypertensives, often with little or no evidence of target organ damage.\nEarly triage to establish the appropriate therapeutic strategies for these patients is critical to limiting morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with severe hypertension may represent as much as 25% of all patient visits to busy urban emergency rooms. Patients with a hypertensive emergency should be admitted to an Intensive Care Unit for continuous monitoring of BP and parenteral administration of an appropriate agent (Table ). The initial goal of therapy in hypertensive emergencies is to reduce mean arterial BP by no more than 25% (within minutes to 1 hour), then, if stable, to 160/100 to 110 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours. Excessive falls in pressure that may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia should be avoided. For this reason, short-acting nifedipine is no longer considered acceptable in the initial treatment of hypertensive emergencies or urgencies. If this level of BP is well tolerated and the patient is clinically stable, further gradual reductions toward a normal BP can be implemented in the next 24 to 48 hours. There are exceptions to the above recommendation-patients with an ischemic stroke in which there is no clear evidence from clinical trials to support the use of immediate antihypertensive treatment, patients with aortic dissection who should have their SBP lowered to \u03fd100 mm Hg if tolerated, and patients in whom BP is lowered to enable the use of thrombolytic agents (see the section on stroke).\nSome patients with hypertensive urgencies may benefit from treatment with an oral, short-acting agent such as captopril, labetalol, or clonidine followed by several hours of observation. However, there is no evidence to suggest that failure to aggressively lower BP in the emergency room is associated with any increased short-term risk to the patient who presents with severe hypertension. Such a patient may also benefit from adjustment in their antihypertensive therapy, particularly the use of combination drugs, or reinstitution of medications if noncompliance is a problem. Most importantly, patients should not leave the emergency room without a confirmed follow-up visit within 1 to a few days.\nUnfortunately, the term \"urgency\" has led to overly aggressive management of many patients with severe, uncomplicated hypertension. Aggressive dosing with intravenous drugs or even oral agents to rapidly lower BP is not without risk. Oral loading doses of antihypertensive agents can lead to cumulative effects causing hypotension, sometimes following discharge from the emergency room. Patients who continue to be noncompliant will often return to the emergency room within weeks.", "heading": "Hypertensive Crises: Emergencies and Urgencies"}, {"text": "Erectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the inability to have and maintain an erection adequate for intercourse, becomes increasingly common in men over 50 years old and is even more common if they are hypertensive. In a survey of over 3000 health professionals, the frequency of ED was 4% in men under age 50, 26% in those 50 to 59, and 40% in those 60 to 69. The frequency was significantly higher if they were hypertensive, diabetic, obese, or smokers or were taking antidepressants or BBs.\nWhereas hypertension per se may be associated with ED, 317 the use of various antihypertensive medications may increase the incidence, in part because BP lowering itself may cause reduction of perfusion of genital organs. Available data regarding individual effects of antihypertensive drug therapy are confounded by age, vascular disease, and hormonal status. In the TOMHS study involving antihypertensive drugs from five different classes (excluding ARBs), participants randomized to chlorthalidone reported a significantly higher incidence of erection problems at 24 months of the study than participants randomized to placebo. Incidence rates through 48 months were more similar among treatment groups than at 24 months, with nonsignificant differences between chlorthalidone and placebo groups. In the VA Cooperative trial, no difference in incidence of sexual dysfunction was noted between a CCB, ACEI, hydrochlorothiazide, or BB compared with placebo. In other studies, centrally acting \u2423-agonists have been associated with ED, while ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs have not been observed to increase its incidence. A lower risk of ED was reported among men who were physically active, not obese, and nonsmokers. Therefore, lifestyle modifications should be encouraged to forestall ED. If ED appears after institution of antihypertensive drug therapy, the offending agent should be discontinued and treatment restarted with another agent. Sildenafil or other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may be prescribed without a significant likelihood of adverse reactions in those with concomitant antihypertensive therapy so long as nitrates are avoided. There are no definitive data on a relation between sexual dysfunction and hypertension in women. Regardless of gender, clinicians should be willing to discuss sexual dysfunction problems and offer counseling to improve the patient's quality of life.\nTABLE 23.

In urgent situations, rapidly acting parenteral agents such as sodium nitroprusside, nicardipine, and labetalol can be utilized to attain effective control very rapidly.

Obesity is so common in OSA that the index of suspicion for OSA should be high in any hypertensive patient whose BMI is above 27 kg/m 2 . 331 These individuals should be questioned thoroughly for symptoms of OSA, including snoring, witnessed apnea, irregular breathing during sleep, restless sleeping, and chronic morning fatigue. Frequently it is the sleep partner who provides the most reliable history, especially regarding snoring, because the affected individual may deny or be unaware of the problem. If the diagnosis is suspected clinically, confirmation by a formal sleep study is indicated. The impact of sleep apnea on CVD is probably related in large part to its association with elevated BP. However, OSA may act through a number of mechanisms to elicit myocardial and vascular damage, including increase in catecholamine release, activation of inflammatory mechanisms, 335 insulin resistance, 336,337 and endothelial dysfunction. Other cardiovascular conditions associated with OSA include arrhythmias, HF, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Previous debate about whether OSA is an etiologic factor in hypertension has focused largely around the strong association of OSA with obesity. While obesity is known to contribute in large part to OSA, patients with OSA may also be at increased risk for weight gain, 349 and treatment of OSA may reduce visceral fat. It now appears that the potential causal association between OSA and hypertension involves both the obesity-hypertension link and an independent role of OSA in chronic BP elevation. Episodes of apnea with repeated oxygen desaturation in OSA have been shown to stimulate strong sympathetic nervous system discharges that directly elevate BP. Poorer quality of sleep and shorter sleep periods may play a reinforcing role in the fatigue and daytime somnolence. Sleep deprivation alone may raise BP 351 and impair glucose tolerance. There is also a direct relationship between the severity of sleep apnea and the level of BP. Finally, sustained and effective treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been reported to lower nighttime and daytime BP in hypertensives with OSA. In addition to weight loss, improvements in the quality of sleep in OSA patients can occur as a result of a variety of positioning measures during sleep, particularly sleeping on one's side. Treatment with CPAP can be useful in overall BP lowering and may also improve cardiac ischemia and HF symptoms. The role of oral prostheses and surgical approaches remains to be fully defined. No specific class of antihypertensive drugs has yet been demonstrated to be superior for BP lowering in OSA patients. 354", "heading": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea"}, {"text": "Hypertension can effect the retina, choroid, and optic nerve of the eye, particularly with stage 2 hypertension. These changes can be appreciated with inspection of the retinal vessels by direct ophthalmoscopy, photography, or angiography.\nHypertensive retinopathy is most commonly manifested by generalized or focal narrowing of retinal arterioles. In acute or advanced hypertension, the retinal vasculature may be injured sufficiently to cause occlusion or leakage. These changes may be manifested as nerve fiber layer infarcts (soft exudates or cotton-wool patches), extravascular edema (hard exudates), intraretinal hemorrhages, and retinal arterial macroaneurysms.\nHypertensive choroidopathy is most frequently seen in young patients with acute hypertension, including cases of eclampsia or pheochromocytoma. Findings include Elschnig spots (nonperfused areas of the choriocapillaris) and Siegrist streaks (linear hyperpigmentation over choroidal arteries).\nHypertensive optic neuropathy occurring with severe hypertension may present with flame hemorrhages, optic disc edema, venous congestion, and macular exudates. Renal Transplantation Hypertension is a relatively common occurrence in patients receiving organ transplants; in those receiving kidney allografts, the prevalence of hypertension probably exceeds 65%. Nocturnal hypertension, a reversal of diurnal BP rhythm, may be present in these individuals who may need ABPM to evaluate overall BP control. Hypertension is less common in other forms of transplantation. The mechanisms of hypertension in transplant patients are multifactorial, but vasoconstriction and long-term vascular structural changes caused by chronic immunosuppressive drugs that are calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and corticosteroids are among the most important. Impaired renal function is another exacerbating factor; despite successful renal transplantation, most patients have enough impairment in renal function to cause relative salt and water retention. Transplant renal artery stenosis may also be a factor.\nObservational studies suggest that hypertension correlates with deterioration in graft function. Large-scale, controlled clinical trials on the effects of BP control on GFR decline or on CVD incidence are lacking in this population. The high risk of graft occlusion and cardiovascular events has suggested that BP should be lowered to 130/80 mm Hg or less. Because of the absence of compelling data, no particular class of antihypertensives can be considered to be superior to any other. The difficulty of lowering BP in this group makes combination drugs necessary in almost all patients. As with other renal diseases, serum creatinine and potassium should be monitored 1 to 2 weeks following initiation or escalation in therapy with ACEIs or ARBs. A greater than 1 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine should raise the question of renal artery stenosis.", "heading": "Hypertension and the Eye"}, {"text": "Hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis may be associated with all stages of hypertension, but it is more commonly recognized in patients with stage 2 or resistant hypertension, since these are the individuals in whom special evaluation for the problem is carried out. If present bilater-ally, renal artery stenosis can lead to reduced kidney function (ischemic nephropathy). Clinical clues to renovascular disease include (1) onset of hypertension before age 30 (especially without a family history) or recent onset of significant hypertension after age 55; (2) an abdominal bruit, particularly if it continues into diastole and is lateralized; (3) accelerated or resistant hypertension; ( ) recurrent (flash) pulmonary edema; (5) renal failure of uncertain etiology, especially with a normal urinary sediment; (6) coexisting diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease, especially in heavy smokers; or (7) acute renal failure precipitated by antihypertensive therapy, particularly ACEIs or ARBs. In patients with indications of renovascular disease, captoprilenhanced radionuclide renal scan, duplex Doppler flow studies, and magnetic resonance angiography may be used as noninvasive screening tests. Three-dimensional images can be obtained by spiral computed tomography, a technique that necessitates the use of intravenous contrast. Definitive diagnosis of renovascular disease requires renal angiography, which carries some risk, particularly of radiocontrast-induced acute renal failure or atheroembolism. In patients, usually women, with fibromuscular dysplasia, results of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) have been excellent and comparable to surgical revascularization. Patients with normal renal function and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis that is focal, unilateral, and nonostial also may be managed by angioplasty. Renal artery stenting has become an important adjunct to PTRA, being used to counteract elastic recoil and to abolish the residual stenosis often observed after PTRA. Even though many patients with high-grade renal artery stenosis remain stable for prolonged periods if BP is well controlled, 367 surgical revascularization or PTRA with renal artery stenting may be needed to preserve renal function.", "heading": "Patients with Renovascular Disease"}, {"text": "Many prescription drugs and some over-the-counter agents and herbal supplements may affect BP and complicate BP control in treated hypertensives. Consequently, searching for the presence of these agents in the medical history can identify a secondary component contributing to BP elevation. Such recognition may negate the need to employ unnecessary and potentially hazardous testing. Use of agents that can affect BP in a given patient should be suspected in the following situations: (1) loss of control of previously well-controlled hypertension, (2) presence of comorbidities (particularly osteoarthritis), (3) biochemical evidence of intercurrent drug usage (such as an increase in serum potassium or creatinine concentrations with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and (4) atypical hypertension (such as severe but transient hypertension in a young patient presenting with chest pain and ECG changes accompanying possible cocaine usage).\nTable provides a list of those agents that may alter BP. They may affect BP in several ways. They may affect sodium balance; increase adrenergic or suppress parasympathetic neural activity; alter the production, release, or effectiveness of vasoactive hormones; or exert direct effects on the endothelium or vascular smooth muscle.", "heading": "Drugs and Other Agents Affecting Blood Pressure"}, {"text": "Modest consumption of alcohol (eg, \u03fd30 g of ethanol a day or approximately two drinks daily) is not generally associated with BP increases. Larger amounts of alcohol ingestion have a dose-related effect on BP, both in hypertensive and normo-tensive subjects. The use of ambulatory BP monitoring has highlighted the biphasic effects of alcohol on BP, underscoring the importance of the timing of BP measurement. A large intake of alcohol (\u03fe30 g) may lower BP in the first 4 hours after ingestion. Approximately 10 to 15 hours later (perhaps at the time a patient is seen for an office visit or in the emergency room during withdrawal), BP increase may be noted. This accounts for some of the discrepancies reported in the literature about alcohol's effect on BP. The mechanism(s) of alcohol's effect on BP are unclear but appear to result predominantly from sympathetic neural activation, although changes in cortisol and cellular calcium concentrations also may play a role.", "heading": "Alcohol"}, {"text": "NANSAIDs represent one of the most common medication classes consumed by hypertensive patients. Among the NAN-SAIDs, older agents like indomethacin are the most extensively studied. BP responses vary within the class of the NANSAIDs; however, increases in pressure are often accompanied by peripheral edema and weight gain, supporting a salt-retention mechanism of hypertension associated with the loss of natriuretic prostaglandins such as PGE 2 . Reduction in the well-described vasodilatory effects of some prostaglandins is another mechanism. COX-2 inhibitors also may cause elevation in BP. Recently, a double-blind randomized trial was conducted evaluating the effects of celecoxib, rofecoxib, and naproxen on 24-hour BP in type 2 diabetic patients with osteoarthritis whose hypertension was treated with ACEIs or ARBs. At equally efficacious doses for the management of osteoarthritis, treatment with rofecoxib, but not celecoxib or naproxen, induced a significant increase in average 24-hour SBP in type 2 diabetic patients receiving ACEIs or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Thus, current data suggest that certain NSAIDs and COX 2 inhibitors may have destabilizing effects on BP control in diabetic hypertensive patients.

Failure to titrate or combine medications and to reinforce lifestyle modifications despite knowing that the patient is not at goal BP represents clinical inertia that must be overcome. This may be due in part to clinician focus on relieving symptoms, a lack of familiarity with clinical guidelines, or discomfort in titrating to a goal. A number of approaches are available to overcome clinical inertia. One of the most effective is to use decision support systems that prompt the clinician to advance therapy when a goal has not been achieved (Table ). Such systems can be electronic (computer-or PDA-based) or paper-based (flow charts, algorithms, guidelines). Feedback reminders from any source (computer-based, automated telephone-based, nurse care managers, outside auditors) can be very effective in not only helping to achieve BP goals but to alert clinicians to missed patient appointments, necessary prescription refills, and laboratory abnormalities. Patient-centered behavioral interventions such as counseling improve BP control (Table ). Nurse clinicians and pharmacists have proven their effectiveness in helping to achieve goal BP. Commercial health plans may provide resources for chart auditing or other assistance to improve BP control. Clinicians should periodically audit their own patient files to assess their degree of compliance and success with established goals and treatment interventions.\nThe National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has established the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), a set of standardized performance measures designed to ensure that purchasers and consumers have the information they need to reliably assess quality of health care ().

NCQA now monitors physician records for the percent of patients whose BP is less than 140/90 mm Hg. 381 BP control rates by physicians so monitored have increased to as high as 59%.

A cluster analysis of 727 hypertensive patients found that the individuals fell into 4 categories. The largest group (39%) was health-oriented, informed about hypertension, and took their medication. A second group (16%) tended to rely on medication rather than lifestyle to control their BP. The third group (22%) had the highest BMI, did not practice health-promoting lifestyle except for low rates of alcohol consumption and tobacco abuse, often forgot to take their medication, and had a lower BP control rate. These patients may benefit most from clinical counseling and help in achieving lifestyle modifications and will likely require more frequent office visits or contact with nurses or other providers. The last group (23%) was more likely to be male and young, knew less about hypertension, was least afraid of consequences of hypertension or failure to take their medication, and was most likely to consume alcohol, abuse tobacco, and stop medication without informing their physician.

Behavior change is more successfully facilitated using this approach along with motivational interviewing rather than assigning the same intervention to every patient. Patients can be asked, using a 1 to 10 ranking, how likely they are to follow the plan. If not likely, the clinician can use motivational interviewing to identify the barriers to adherence. At visits where BP is above goal, alterations in the treatment plan should be made and documented accordingly. Home BP devices can be very useful in involving many patients in their own care. Devices must be calibrated by the clinician (see the section Self Measurement). This should be done, in part, by having the patient determine their BP with the device in the presence of the clinician. Home-determined BP tends to be approximately 5 mm Hg lower than office BP, and this information should be considered when assessing progress toward goal.

To date, the importance of a family history of CHD in blacks has received little attention, though blacks with a family history have a relative risk that is as high as 5 times that of the general population. In the Heritage Family Heart Study, familial aggregation of CHD risk was stronger in blacks than in whites. Among first-degree relatives of CHD probands, sibs bear the greatest increased risk, likely as a result of genes and shared environment. The prevalences of smoking; untreated, undertreated, and poorly controlled hypertension; and hypercholesterolemia are particularly high in blacks with a family history of premature CHD. Traditional medical models of CHD risk reduction have not been effective in black populations. Access to care, cultural competence of providers, trust in the healthcare system, work and child-care needs, opportunities for a healthy diet and exercise, educational resources, and access to affordable pharmacotherapy have all been cited as causally related to health disparities among blacks. Few studies have examined care models that explicitly eliminate known barriers to effective multiple CHD risk factor reduction in high-risk black populations, such as families with premature CHD. It has been suggested that if these barriers were addressed in traditional primary care, there would be a notable reduction in risk factors, sufficient to at least partially ameliorate racial disparities in CHD risk. On the other hand, an important major barrier may be discordance of the primary care delivery model itself with the culture of the black community. The present study was designed to determine the relative effectiveness of an alternative model of community-based care (CBC) provided in the black community compared with \"enhanced\" primary care (EPC), in which the major barriers are addressed in both groups: the former in a way that is designed by community members and the latter by enhancing the traditional method of primary care delivery.

The suite consisted of a comfortable conference room for counseling; a clinical room for phlebotomy and physical examination; an exercise room containing a treadmill, weights, Thera-Band resistive exercise equipment, and a choice of music; and a living room with a children's play area. The original purpose of the exercise room was to evaluate shifts in exercise blood pressure with therapy and to expose people to the physical \"experience\" of exercise in a safe environment. Appointments were not necessary, and the Family Heart Center was open from 9 AM until 5 PM Monday through Friday, with evenings and Saturday appointments available if requested.\nOn each CBC visit, the nurse practitioner performed a brief physical assessment including blood pressure measurements. The nurse practitioner evaluated patients for pharmacotherapy and monitored compliance. The community health worker saw sibs for all dietary counseling, smoking cessation, and exercise counseling. The average total visit was 30 minutes. Telephone interventions to monitor progress were available. The progress of each sib was reviewed by the study physician with the CBC team twice monthly. The nurse practitioner communicated all changes in pharmacotherapy with the primary care physician by mail. Health concerns that did not involve risk factors were referred to the primary care physician, and nurse practitioner involvement was proscribed. Primary care providers were asked to refrain from providing care for criterion risk factors and not to change related therapy. The decisions of how to apply the guidelines were within the full purview of the nurse practitioner. This was done to create a decision environment most like that of usual primary care providers.\nAll sibs requiring pharmacotherapy were given a pharmacy charge service (PCS) card that allowed them to obtain their risk factor therapy prescriptions free of charge at any pharmacy. When a prescription was filled, a bill was generated that was paid from unrestricted funds provided to the study by several pharmaceutical companies (see Acknowledgments). The PCS service provided the study with information about whether prescriptions were filled.\nSibs also could attend 2 free evening sessions per week at the YMCA conducted by the community health worker. Sessions included aerobics, stretch exercises, Thera-Band resistance training, and water aerobics.

Recent expert reviews of health disparities have concluded that effective strategies remain elusive and that studies are needed. This is the first trial, to our knowledge, that was designed explicitly to test the comparative effectiveness of a community intervention model and a primary care model in which the major barriers are addressed in both groups. The results offer several insights that address disparities. First, sibs assigned to the CBC intervention were more likely to reduce their levels of LDL-C and blood pressure and also showed a significant reduction in global CHD risk. Second, the EPC group demonstrated a smaller improvement in risk factors, suggesting that barrier-reducing enhancements to primary care may improve individual risk factor outcomes only modestly. Third, even in the best-case scenario in which the major well-known barriers to care have been markedly reduced, risk factor goals were not attained by a relatively large number of individuals in both groups. Fourth, even though individual risk factors changed in the EPC group, the magnitude of change was not sufficient to shift global CHD risk for either total or hard CHD events. The superior results in the CBC group may have been mediated in part through the community health worker, who served as a culturally sensitive navigator through the systems needed to alter risk factors, ie, how to fill and use a prescription, how to shop for and prepare healthier foods, and how to access an exercise facility.

Readily accessible community care and a flexible structure helped people to return for evaluation. Unexpectedly, the small exercise room at the CBC site was a strong incentive. Participants often came to exercise for 20 to 30 minutes at lunchtime or before or after work, whereas commitment to a full evening at the YMCA 2 days a week appeared to be more difficult. Still, 20% of CBC participants exercised at the YMCA, enabled by a direct invitation from the community health worker. Telephone interventions allowed participants to report progress on their own schedule. The regression models demonstrate a significant benefit of the CBC intervention after adjustment for educational level and baseline levels of risk factors. This finding strongly supports the effectiveness of the CBC beyond simple improved use of pharmacotherapy.\nStatin therapy was far more effective for lipid control than antihypertensive therapy was for blood pressure control. Although not quantitatively analyzed, patient care notes suggest that it was difficult to convince some participants to take a statin because of fear of side effects as noted in television advertising and the perception that this agent \"had not been tested\" in black populations. Efforts to garner trust by the nurse practitioner and community health worker were used to optimize acceptance of pharmacotherapy. Decisions about care were a negotiated process between sibs and the nurse practitioner or community health worker. Without negotiation, when people encounter side effects, concerns about costs, mistrust, or fear of the drug, they may be more likely to elect volitional noncompliance. It has been suggested that interventions that address these same barriers in primary care settings could eliminate disparities in US health care. In our study, however, the impact of interventions to address most known barriers did not shift global CHD risk in primary care settings. CBC, with an alternative infrastructure, in contrast, showed a significant shift in predicted CHD risk. Because the EPC settings had patient education materials, free medications, exercise opportunities, and a comprehensive screening with results and expert recommendations, failure to shift global CHD risk suggests that even with the putative major barriers addressed, the usual care system infrastructure may not be optimal for risk reduction in current black culture.", "heading": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A cost-effectiveness analysis was not conducted, and the long-term benefits are not known.

The current primary care delivery model lacks a multidisciplinary infrastructure that is conducive to effective management of multiple CHD risk factors . The growing strain of chronic disease management on the health care system leaves physicians little time for preventive care , which paradoxically is indispensable for the treatment and prevention of many chronic diseases including CHD. While CHD affects every racial/ethnic group and social class, ethnic minorities and persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) disproportionately bear the burden of CHD and its major risk factors , These population subgroups also are more likely to receive substandard cardiac care compared with whites and individuals of higher SES . Accelerating the translation of research into community-based practice and enhancing health impact in disparate populations have been identified as strategic imperatives for the elimination of inequities in cardiovascular health .\nAlternative approaches are needed to supplement traditional one-on-one sessions between patients and doctors. One such approach is integrated care delivered through case management (CM). Case management is a comprehensive, longitudinal approach that involves a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, such as physicians, nurses and dietitians, who simultaneously intervene to reduce multiple risk factors for a disease, such as CHD. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of intensive case management intervention to reduce multiple cardiovascular risk factors among predominantly white, high-risk patients . Only recently has this therapeutic approach been tested among ethnic minorities, where it was found to be effective . Researchers have urged greater implementation of case management .

The switching-over design not only addresses ethical concerns about withholding treatment from half the study sample, but will also enable us to assess whether the intervention had equal impact whether provided to a na\u00efve population or to a group followed in usual care for 15 months. We will compare change in CHD risk from baseline to 15 months for Immediate Intervention with that from 15 months to 30 months for Delayed Intervention. Similar magnitudes of change in CHD risk between the two study arms would imply that the Delayed Intervention arm was not notably contaminated by the intervention and measurement process and that no noteworthy differences were caused by the 15-month difference in time per se.\nImmediate Intervention patients who complete their 12month maintenance period and Delayed Intervention patients who complete their 15-month case management period remain under maintenance case management until they are fully transitioned back to the care of the SMMC in the last year of the project. In addition to patient transition, we will also transition the HTH case management model, as guided by outcomes data from the clinical trial, into an ongoing disease management program operated by SMMC. By including this transition phase, we will be able to assure continuity in patient care and also test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing our intervention in a community practice setting.", "heading": "Study design"}, {"text": "Between October 2003 and April 2005, 1005 patients were referred by physicians at four SMMC outpatient clinics located in Menlo Park, Redwood City, South San Francisco, and Daly City. These four clinics were chosen for geographic proximity, accommodating clinic environment, sufficient patient volume, diverse patient demographics, and established adult primary care services. All data acquisition and case management visits took place at the clinic where the patient usually receives his/her primary care.\nPhysicians at the study clinics were instructed to refer male and female patients between the ages of 35 and 85 who had CHD, CHD risk equivalents (i.e., abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, or diabetes mellitus), or moderately to severely elevated levels of major CHD risk factors. We were unable to contact 257 of the 1005 referred patients and an additional 142 declined participation (Figure ). We screened the remaining 596 patients by phone or at the baseline visit and excluded 143 patients for failing to meet the exclusion criteria. These criteria identify patients with circumstances that may severely limit their ability complete the study protocol or that may confound results of the study. The footnotes in table 1 list percentages by exclusion criteria. During the same phone call, those not excluded were scheduled for a baseline visit. Table enumerates study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consent forms were available in English and Spanish and the patient's informed consent was obtained before the start of the baseline visit. For patients who spoke a language other than English or Spanish, a family member over the age of 18 or a SMMC staff member served as interpreter. As part of the baseline evaluation, biophysical measures were obtained that further excluded 44 patients not meeting inclusion criteria.", "heading": "Recruitment"}, {"text": "A total of 419 patients met all study criteria and provided informed consent. They were randomized into Immediate or Delayed Intervention groups, using the permuted block method stratified by gender and ethnicity (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic). A statistician independent of the study generated a sequence of 100 randomization IDs and treatment assignments per clinic for each of the four combinations of gender and ethnicity, i.e. 1) female, Hispanic, 2) male, Hispanic, 3) female, non-Hispanic, and 4) male, non-Hispanic. An administrative assistant who is not involved in the study printed the IDs and corresponding treatment assignments on separate pages and sealed each page into an opaque envelope. The administrative assistant then placed these envelopes by stratification group and in randomization sequence into four envelope containers for use at each clinic. All case managers were masked to randomization sequence and treatment assignments. At the baseline/randomization visit, each eligible and willing participant was instructed to take the envelope in the very front of the appropriate container, open the envelope in the presence of the case manager, and read his group randomization. The participant would then sign the randomization form and the case manager would record the participant's randomization assignment and the randomization ID number on the randomization disposition form.\nRandomization occurred at the patient level in this trial. Randomization at the clinic or physician level would cast detrimental doubts on internal validity of the trial as it would not be feasible to guarantee a balanced distribution of the diversity of clinic sites and physician practice patterns across the study arms. Consequently, it would be difficult to determine whether outcomes reflected the intervention or differences in patient populations across sites and differences in physician practice patterns. A drawback of patient-level randomization is the possibility of contamination. We expect the extent and impact of contamination to be modest, however. By design, studyspecific case managers who are independent of existing physician practices within the study clinic sites provide case-management to the intervention patients and the scheduling process is separate from that of the clinical sites. Much of the value of the intervention comes from activities that are not usually given high priority by primary care physicians. In addition, any potential for contamination produces a conservative bias, reducing the measured impact of the intervention and biasing the findings towards the null hypothesis. Furthermore, our statistical methods will specifically address the degree of intraclass correlation within physician's practices and thereby assess the likelihood and potential extent of contamination.", "heading": "Randomization"}, {"text": "The primary outcome measure is the absolute CHD risk over 10 years.

Plasma HbA1c was obtained utilizing the Cholestech GDX.\nPatients were asked about medical and family history related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). They were asked to bring all medications, including supplements and nutraceuticals, with them to the baseline visit. Medication name, medication class, dosage, and therapeutic purpose were recorded. Patients with CHD and/or diabetes were specifically asked about their use of \u03b2-blockers, statins, ACEIs/ARBs, and aspirin.

Specific lifestyle and medical protocols for case managers were developed from these guidelines and continue to be updated based on new evidence. Each patient was managed by a nurse practitioner/registered nurse and a dietitian. Guided by the intervention protocols, the intensity of case management was individualized based on patient risk profile, patient preferences, and available resources within the community. The aim for each patient was to improve individual risk factors and reach recommended goals. Supervised by two physicians and a senior nurse practitioner, the case managers reviewed, adjusted as necessary, and monitored medical therapies in accordance to guidelines and the SMMC formulary. Lifestyle modification was strongly emphasized as a critical component of achieving CHD prevention goals. In particular, dietary management was emphasized, including recommendation of a low saturated fat (less than 7% of caloric intake), low cholesterol (< 150 mg/ day), mainly plant-based diet with calorie restrictions for overweight/obese persons. Stress management and coping skills along with physical activity also was emphasized, including recommendations of a regular exercise regimen (\u2265 30 minutes of moderate intensity on most days).

To test the primary hypothesis, we will compare Immediate Intervention participants relative to Delayed Intervention participants in a random-effects regression using SAS PROC GLIMMIX. The dependent variable will be the standardized Framingham risk score at 15-month follow-up. Initially, covariates will be limited to the baseline risk score and intervention status. So we will model participant i (i = 1, 2,..., n jk ) under the care of physician j within clinic k as: where Risk 1ijk is the standardized risk score for the i-th participant at 15 months (time 1) cared for by physician j in clinic k, Risk 0ijk is the risk score at baseline (time 0), Intijk is the intervention vs. control status of the i-th participant in the same clinic and under the same physician, b 0 is a constant term, b 1 is the coefficient associated with impact of baseline risk, and b 2 is the coefficient associated with the impact of the intervention. \u03b1 j represents the random effect caused by physician j and \u03b2 k is the random clinic effect.

Our primary hypothesis will be confirmed if the coefficient associated with the intervention (b 2 ) is significantly less than 0, implying that the intervention decreased CHD risk scores independent of the baseline level.\nIn addition, we will evaluate a number of secondary topics including: a) baseline differences in CHD prevention practices, b) moderators and mediators of the intervention effect, c) durability of the intervention effect, and d) cost effectiveness of the intervention. For example, some of the secondary hypotheses we will be testing include a) at baseline, CHD prevention practices within the SMMC fell significantly short of attaining guideline-based goals for a range of risk factors; b) at baseline, adherence to prevention guidelines varied directly by SES with adherence being least likely among participants of the lowest SES; c) implementation of the intervention had a greater impact on participants of lower SES thus resulting in a reduction on the magnitude of socioeconomic disparities in CHD prevention; d) changes in patient dietary and exercise habits were the largest mediators of the impact of the intervention; and e) the change in risk factors attributable to intervention was sufficient to achieve reasonable costeffectiveness relative to other medical therapies.\nIn the current manuscript, we presented comparisons of baseline characteristics between the two study arms.

For example, these covariates may include SES, change in caloric intake, and change in physical activity. The costeffectiveness analysis will include: measurement of costs, measurement of changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and calculation of a cost-effectiveness ratio with an appropriate confidence region. The cost of implement-ing HTH will be estimated based on the cost of HTH staff time whereas the cost of implementing usual care will be derived from SMMC administrative records. We will estimate a statistical model of QALY changes based on the change in risk of death and, among survivors, the reduction in quality of life due to non-fatal events, which will be approximated using the collected health care utilization data. Using the cost and QALY figures we will estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, representing the cost per QALY due to the intervention, and a 95% confidence region surrounding the cost-effectiveness ratio using a bootstrapping method.

The HTH sample is unique in its high composition of Latinos/Hispanics (62%) and other ethnic minorities (22%), persons with low educational attainment (61%), and persons without employment (62%). These population groups are clearly labeled in the literature as priority populations disproportionately affected by CVD and who are more likely to receive infe-rior CVD care . The HTH sample exceeded our proposed target of enrollment for women (50%) and Latinos/Hispanics (55%). In addition, our sample consisted of 12% Asians and Pacific Islanders (target: 16%) and 10% African Americans (target: 10%).\nBy design, major cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among HTH participants. 10-year CHD risk averaged 18% in men and 13% in women despite a modest LDL-C level and a high on-treatment percentage at baseline. This should not be surprising given that 63% of participants were diagnosed with diabetes, and an additional 22% with metabolic syndrome. In addition, many participants had depressed HDL-C levels and elevated values of TC:HDL ratio, TG, TG:HDL ratio, and blood pressure. Furthermore, nearly 70% of participants were obese, 45% had a family history of CHD or stroke, and 16% were current smokers.\nA high proportion of the participants in our study were female (65%) although males are likely to be at higher risk for CAD. This reflects the overall higher usage of outpatient health care by women compared to men, as well as the greater availability of women for appointments during daytime working hours. To increase participation of men in future trials, setting aside evening clinic hours would enable men to come to appointments after their workday. In addition, case finding through women may lead to participation of their husbands although this would impose a more complex analytic design to account for the involvement of multiple household members in the same study.

The interrelatedness of cardiovascular risk factors demands an integrated approach to management. However, the current US health care system lacks the capability of providing effective and cost-conscious CVD risk reduction interventions, particularly for ethnic minorities and low-SES populations . Chronic disease management exerts tremendous time demands on PCPs such that achieving guideline-accordant practice is unlikely unless physicians work as part of a health care team in which there is efficient division of labor. Case management provides an excellent team-approach model for integrating multiple risk reduction into practice that strives to meet nationally established goals for CVD risk reduction. Compared to usual care, case management has been shown to improve the delivery of care as well as resulting cardiovascular outcomes among predominantly white, high-risk patients . Data are only beginning to accumulate with regard to the effectiveness of case management among ethnic minorities .\nThe HTH case management program is based on a model that has evolved through several previous clinical trials .\nThe model provides a systematic approach to the comprehensive, individualized and intensive management of cardiovascular risk in at-risk patients. It is based on the premise that cardiovascular risk reduction is synergistic and that CVD prevention and management is most successful when lifestyle interventions are integrated with appropriate medical therapies. At the core of the model is a team of nurses and dietitians (case managers) capable of treating hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking cessation. Case managers provide long-term counseling based on clinical status, risk level, interest in and readiness for change, and personal resources. Case managers' activities are integrated with the activities of the patient's PCP. Case management goals are modeled on latest practice guidelines.\nTo conclude, baseline characteristics of HTH participants suggest that we have recruited an appropriate cohort in which to implement a case management approach and test its efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Due to its unique composition of ethnic minorities and persons of low-SES, the HTH will enrich the U.S. literature regarding better strategies for CVD prevention among these priority popu-lation groups and aid in guiding future practice that will reduce health disparities. The HTH experience also will be of considerable learning value for health care systems in Canada, the United Kingdom, and other countries that have shown increasing interest in the clinical utility of the case management model . Our experience to date has led to success in a number of areas that are likely to translate into final success of the project. Among these: 1) developing a mutually supportive and productive collaboration with SMMC; 2) developing the HTH model both in terms of its intellectual and evidence-based foundation, as well as all its logistical elements; 3) successfully recruiting slightly more than the expected number of patients; 4) recruiting and retaining a cohesive staff of providers and researchers; 5) eliciting a favorable response from San Mateo County regarding the intervention and plans to disseminate the intervention to additional clinical sites as a County-run program.", "heading": "Proportion of randomized participants with CVD and CVD risk factors"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving how patients and physicians address patient self-care.\n\nMethods and design:\nThis paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 \u00d7 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or to the physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. The physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months, and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to the patient intervention or to usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly phone contacts by community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were performed at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months.", "sections": {"list": [{"text": "Approximately 50 million adult Americans have hypertension , which is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease and accounts for approximately 35% of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) . Fortunately, the treatment of hypertension reduces associated risks: lowering blood pressure (BP) by a variety of strategies reduces the risk of stroke by approximately 35%, congestive heart failure by 42%, and coronary heart disease by 28% . Therefore, an important key to reducing the burden of hypertension-related CVD is to increase the proportion of patients who achieve optimal BP control. To promote this goal, the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Evaluation, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) has established guidelines that have been widely disseminated to practitioners through the National Institutes of Health High Blood Pressure Education Program and other organizations .\nThe latest JNC guidelines (JNC-7), published in 2003, classify BP into stages and provide recommendations for treatment and follow-up. The recommended goal for patients with uncomplicated hypertension is an average systolic BP of less than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg. For patients with certain comorbid conditions that increase risk (i.e., diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease), the goal BP is less than 130/80 mm Hg .\nTreatments for high blood pressure are classified as lifestyle modification or medication. The guidelines direct physicians to prescribe lifestyle modification to all patients with BP that is above the optimal category (> 120/80 mm Hg). The recommendations for lifestyle modification are evidence-based and include adoption of a healthy dietary pattern such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet , losing weight if overweight, reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and limiting alcohol intake . Each of these behavioral interventions has been shown to lower BP and contribute to hypertension control. For medication therapy, the guidelines indicate when and whom to treat and also provide advice on choice of drug, when and how to adjust doses, and how to minimize non-adherence to therapy. The explicit intent of the guidelines is to assist physicians in achieving goal BP in the majority of their patients.\nTwo behaviors that could improve BP control are physicians' adherence to JNC-7 guidelines and patients' adherence to lifestyle recommendations and medication regimens. Several similarities exist between behavioral models that attempt to explain why physicians do or do not follow guidelines for preventive care and those that attempt to explain why patients do or do not adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors . For the physician, awareness (knowledge), motivation, and confidence (self-efficacy) all influence adherence to guidelines. For instance, physicians who do not know about or do not feel motivated to follow the JNC guidelines are not likely to prescribe them, nor are physicians who have the knowledge and motivation but lack confidence to follow the guidelines. Non-behavioral factors can also influence physicians' actions. These include external or systemslevel factors such as time constraints, resources, and systems to prompt or remind physicians of the guidelines .\nSimilarly, behavioral factors may also influence patients' adherence to lifestyle recommendations and medications . Patients who are unaware that they need to change their behavior or who are not motivated will not change. In addition, external factors including food availability and environmental structures may affect how patients adhere to a healthy lifestyle. The Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP) behavioral interventions were designed to target the same psychosocial mediators and systems factors for both physicians and patients, presented graphically in Figure .\nStrategies for implementing recommended practice to improve clinical outcomes include dissemination of printed educational materials (e.g., clinical practice guidelines), physician and patient training, feedback to physicians, dissemination of information linked to performance (e.g., audit and feedback, reminder systems), clinical performance measures (CPMs), and simple clinical bedside tools. Although randomized trials of these strategies are rare, there is evidence that such tools can change medical provider behavior and improve clinical outcomes . A major challenge is the integration of practice improvement strategies into the flow of clinical care; to accomplish this, health researchers and providers have borrowed techniques of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). It is the application of a CQI approach-applying tools shown to be effective-that forms the foundation for the HIP physician intervention.\nThe patient also plays a critical role in hypertension care. As noted above, the JNC guidelines include lifestyle modification for all patients with hypertension. Programs that result in successful lifestyle behavior change are generally based on Social Cognitive Theory and techniques of behavioral self-management . They are typically constructed using the Transtheoretical Model and motivational enhancement approaches . These approaches emphasize the importance of the individual's ability to regulate behavior by setting goals, developing specific behavior change plans, monitoring progress towards the goals, and attaining skills necessary to reach the goals. Self-efficacy (i.e., one's confidence in performing a given behavior) and outcome expectations (i.e., one's belief that changing behavior leads to a favorable outcome) are critical mediators of behavior change . An example of this approach can be found in the PREMIER trial of lifestyle interventions for blood pressure control-a multi-center trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute that tested the effects on BP of 2 multi-component lifestyle interventions, relative to an advice-only control condition . The PREMIER study demonstrated that a 6-month intensive behavioral intervention leads to healthy lifestyle changes, significant reductions in BP, and improved control of hypertension.\nAs is true for most chronic illnesses, hypertension management requires extensive efforts from physicians and Psychosocial mediators and systems factors that influence physician and patient adherence to JNC-7 guidelines Figure Psychosocial mediators and systems factors that influence physician and patient adherence to JNC-7 guidelines. MD = physician. patients alike, with support from the health care system. It was hypothesized that a quality improvement approach would maximize physician adherence to treatment guidelines, and a behavioral intervention would improve patient adherence to lifestyle recommendations. Both approaches may lead to significant improvements in BP control with consequent reductions in CVD risk. The HIP study offers a unique and innovative opportunity to test this hypothesis by determining, in a randomized controlled trial, the separate and combined effect on BP of a physician intervention and a patient intervention. The study design provides for an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of implementing the physician and patient interventions separately, thereby allowing health care organizations to make informed decisions about implementation of 1 or both interventions in the context of local resources.

That is, there was no attempt to change or monitor whatever procedures were already in place in that practice for quality improvement and physician education with regard to BP control. No performance data were collected from these physicians, and no performance feedback was given.\nThe active MD intervention consisted of 3 main elements. The first element included 2 training modules provided as on-line continuing medical education (CME) courses. The first module addressed the JNC-7 guidelines and the second addressed lifestyle modification for BP control. The modules were available in 3 formats (streaming audio, PowerPoint slide show, and print version) so that each physician could choose the most convenient modality. Each module required approximately 45 minutes to complete, included a quiz that gave immediate feedback on the answers, and resulted in CME credit through the Duke CME office. All physicians completed the modules before the first group session of the patient intervention.\nThe second element was an evaluation and treatment algorithm that summarized the major guidelines set forth in JNC-7. The BP management algorithm-derived from the JNC-7 guidelines and formatted as a decision tree-was mass-produced in a color-coded, laminated pocket card (Additional file 1) and provided to each physician randomized to the active MD intervention. The algorithm directly informed the portion of the CPM data form that was completed by the MD (Additional file 2).\nThe third element was a CQI-type procedure involving assessment of CPMs and quarterly feedback to physicians on their adherence to guidelines, including those related to lifestyle counseling. At each clinic randomized to the MD intervention, the clinic staff and participating physician completed a single-page CPM data form every time an HIP participant (in either patient treatment group) had a clinic visit. A clinic nurse completed the top half of the form (BP at current and last clinic visit, comorbidities), and the MD completed the bottom half (current BP medications, actions taken during the visit, follow-up interval). In addition, data from non-study participants were collected on anonymous forms 1 day each month to increase sample sizes for feedback reports. In both cases, the form was attached to the billing encounter form to prompt MDs to complete it. These data were converted into quarterly feedback reports that indicated to each physician: 1) the proportion of hypertensive participants with adequately controlled BP for that quarter and the previous quarters; 2) the proportion not at goal who had medication adjustments at the visit; 3) the proportion that received lifestyle modification counseling; 4) the proportion without diabetes (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were at goal BP and also the proportion prescribed a thiazide diuretic; 5) the proportion with DM and/or CKD who were at goal BP and also the proportion prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blocker; and 6) comparisons with peer MDs for each category.", "heading": "Content and conduct of physician intervention"}, {"text": null, "heading": "Content and conduct of the patient intervention"}, {"text": "Participants randomized to the control group had an individual brief visit with an interventionist after randomization, during which they received advice and brochures on lifestyle modification for BP control consistent with JNC-7.

Ongoing quality assurance for intervention delivery was provided through retraining, observation, and feedback for the interventionists. The patient intervention consisted of 20 weekly sessions provided over approximately 6 months, during which the participants met in small groups (n = 10-15 per group) with an interventionist. All intervention sessions took place at or near the participants' clinic site, providing a familiar location for these sessions.\nSpecific behavior change strategies comprising the HIP patient intervention are listed in Table .

This manual was intended to complement the group session process and content by serving as a workbook during the sessions and as a reference between sessions.\nThe study also employed volunteer community health advisors (CHAs) who were identified and recruited from the same communities as the target population. These \"natural leaders\" were trained to participate in all aspects of the patient intervention. They assisted the interventionists in conducting the group sessions and were asked to lead portions of the activities or discussion so that the intervention was delivered in conjunction with members of the community.

Certification and on-going supervision were similar to that provided to the interventionists.\nThe CHAs served as familiar, non-authoritative resources for study participants, strengthening communication between the research group and the participants and providing additional social support. The intent is that the CHAs will have sufficient knowledge and skills to serve as ongoing resources in their communities and to help sustain the effects of the project after it is completed.\nThe outcomes were measured at the level of the patient, who was exposed to neither intervention, MD intervention alone, patient intervention alone, or both interventions.

The primary hypotheses of interest will be the main effect of the patient intervention, the main effect of the physician intervention, and the patient-by-physician interaction. This last interaction assesses, for example, whether the patient and physician interventions have a separate impact on outcome or, alternatively, whether they act synergistically. For the categorical outcome of percentage of patients at goal, a similar strategy will be followed using logistic regression, and these analyses will also be stratified by whether the patient was at goal at baseline.\nThe analysis plan accounts for the correlations among the responses for individual patients, these correlations being induced by the nesting of time points within patients within physicians within practices. The analysis of variance paradigm will be used, accounting for the correlations among the 3 time points by separately analyzing the paired scores representing differences between baseline and 6 months and between baseline and 18 months.

This DSMB review included a comparison of the results of the study to date (to which the investigators, with the exception of the study statistician, were blinded) with the assumptions of the power calculations. In approximate numbers, instead of 40% of patients maintaining BP control at baseline, the figure was actually 70%. Moreover, over 95% of the patients who were in BP control at baseline were also in control at 6 months, raising the possibility that using a dichotomous BP control variable as the primary outcome would suffer from a ceiling effect. (Note that such a ceiling effect was not necessarily certain; for example, an effect size of 0.3 could still be generated from a pattern of outcomes centered around 70%, but this preliminary analysis did suggest that patients who were in BP control at baseline were likely to provide less information than desired toward distinguishing the impacts of the interventions.)\nIn light of these considerations, the DSMB recommended: (a) to reduce the number of cohorts to 4 (to conserve budget); (b) to focus recruitment in Cohort 4 on patients who were not in BP control at baseline (to ensure that the study population approximated the original target population as much as possible); and (c) to change the primary\nTable 5: Measurement schedule Time/variable Baseline 3 mo. 6 mo. 9 mo. 12 mo. 15 mo. 18 mo.

Patient self-care efforts should be directed at counteracting the effects on BP of obesity, physical inactivity, poor dietary pattern, and non-adherence to prescribed medications . Furthermore, efforts should be made to promote the use of quality improvement systems that can increase physician adherence to established clinical practice guidelines . In addition to improving BP control, these approaches can also reduce costs associated with hypertension and its consequences . However, given the resources required to implement such approaches, it is critical that their effectiveness be rigorously established .\nThe Hypertension Improvement Project is a controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on BP of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement intervention for physicians. The patient intervention employed proven behavioral methods for promoting healthy lifestyle and adherence to medication regimens. The physician intervention used a quality improvement approach to provide training, motivation, and feedback on performance in a non-threatening way to promote continuous self-improvement and adherence to clinical practice guidelines.\nThe physician intervention represents a form of quality improvement that can be described as \"Facilitated Process Improvement\" (FPI) . Similar to CQI, FPI recognizes that a key barrier to implementing systematic improvement programs is provider time: time to become expert in and to apply CQI methodology and time to become familiar with the sorts of interventions that are likely to be effective in a given context. In FPI, several components of the CQI process are delegated to an expert team, with concurrent agreement by providers during education programs. In this case, the team identified the common limiting barriers to optimal outcomes-lack of easy access to guidelines and lack of ongoing feedback regarding conformance to guidelines (the latter issue may be termed \"the difficulty of looking over one's own shoulder\")-and created tools to address those barriers.\nAt the time at which this manuscript was prepared, the trial was in progress. All physicians and patients had been enrolled, and experience with the logistical aspects of study conduct had been garnered. There are numerous unique features and lessons gleaned thus far from the conduct of the trial that will set the stage for interpretation of the study results. More importantly, these features and lessons can inform other investigators planning similar studies.\nSeveral of the challenges faced relate to the setting in which the trial is being conducted (Table ). The study team considered it important to conduct the study in community clinics where such an approach to BP control would ultimately be implemented. Implementation of the HIP trial within a practice-based research network, while innovative, also required attention to issues that are not usually encountered within an academic medical center (AMC). The study required access to work space that was convenient and familiar to participants (i.e., in or near the clinic) but that had minimal impact on clinical care delivery. Not all medical clinics have space for study visits and group intervention sessions. The study team worked closely with clinic staff to schedule study visits on days when clinic rooms were available (e.g., provider day off) and used the waiting room (in the evenings), the clinic conference room, or a nearby facility for the group sessions.\nEven though the study strived to cause minimal disruption to the usual clinic flow, the study team relied on the assistance of clinic personnel to arrange and facilitate several study processes. For example, clinic staff directed participants to the appropriate location for study visits, provided phlebotomy services, distributed blank CPM forms, and collected completed CPM forms. Each of these activities added to the staff's usual responsibilities, but several approaches helped to promote cooperation among study personnel and clinic personnel. First, the study goals and procedures were explained to clinic personnel prior to start-up of a new site. During enrollment and follow-up, the study team maintained frequent and open communication among study coordinators, investi-gators, and clinic management. Lastly, the study budget included modest compensation to the practices and to the enrolled physicians.\nTravel from the AMC to the distant sites (ranging 10-40 miles) was not a trivial issue. The study team tried to travel as a group to minimize costs, and travel expenses were reimbursed. Rising fuel costs during the study affected the budget significantly.\nOther challenges related to the choice of study population. The initial goal was to recruit low-income, ethnic minority participants, who are well-represented in the communities served by the participating clinic network.\nThe study also aimed to comprise a population that was approximately 40% male, as men are often under-represented in lifestyle intervention studies. Because participants were recruited from the practices of enrolled MDs rather than the local community, previously effective targeted recruitment procedures could not be relied upon . However, recruitment was targeted through access to the clinical database serving the participating practices, in which race, insurance, and sex data were available. Enrollment of low-income participants was encouraged by targeting recruitment efforts at patients in the database with no insurance, or with Medicaid or Medicare without supplemental insurance. Patient enrollment demographics were monitored periodically so that subsequent recruitment mailings could be prioritized to ensure a balanced study population. Midway through enrollment, the proportion of men was significantly below goal; in response, mailings and recruitment calls were directed preferentially to men. Despite these efforts, Table indicates that most study participants were at least high school-educated and reported adequate financial resources, and fewer than 40% were men.\nThe patient intervention required weekly attendance at group sessions that lasted up to 2 hours. Several of the clinics served rural areas requiring significant travel by the participants. Some communities were not accustomed to the research activities of AMCs and, thus, patients in those areas may have been less inclined to join a research study for reasons related to lack of trust or information. While these factors mimic challenges to implementation of the patient intervention in real-world settings, they created a greater challenge for recruitment into a research study, especially given that recruitment was based on blind mailings. The initial recruitment letter asked potential participants to call the study team only if they were not interested in participating (an opt-out strategy); if the study team did not receive a response, then a follow-up call was made to answer any questions and determine interest in participating. However, the ratio of calls to enrollees was low, so the recruitment letter was changed to allow patients to also opt in. This option allowed participants to self-select for inclusion, which may have selected more motivated individuals but is still likely to generalize to a real-world implementation of the study intervention, which would ultimately require voluntary participation.\nRecruitment of CHAs was somewhat challenging. The initial goal in enlisting CHAs was to recruit people with \"natural helper\" personalities from the same communities as the target patient population. To that end, flyers were posted in participating clinics, and clinic staffs and community leaders were asked to suggest people from within their communities. The response to this recruitment effort was relatively modest. Although we were able to recruit an adequate number of CHAs for the study with a minimal budget, our selection pool was limited. Future studies incorporating the CHA element may consider including a budget for a greater advertisement effort and other strategies to enhance recruitment.\nChallenges involving the physicians were also encountered. A few providers left their participating clinical practices during the course of the 18-month intervention. In this situation, the provider's patients who were enrolled in HIP were referred to another participating provider within the practice. Also, completion of CPM forms often competed with busy and varying clinic schedules, the demands of patient care, or an upcoming review by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. To minimize the additional work needed for collecting the CPM data, non-carbon copy paper was used, so that the top portion was used for the clinic note and the bottom portion was used for data entry. This was a brief 1-page form-the top portion was designed so that non-MD personnel (e.g., a triage nurse) could fill out the vital signs and medical history, while the bottom portion was filled out by the provider stating the medication changes and counseling that occurred during the visit. The physician strategy was developed by the study investigators who were not fully aware of all the QI initiatives (ongoing or planned) within the practices. The CPM form, while short and simple, was viewed by the practice staff as an additional form of which to keep track, and they had to modify their usual procedures 1 day a month to collect these data. With the increased use of electronic medical records, future studies should be able to integrate the collection of information about medication changes and counseling within routine charting, although this would also remove a reminder system that might contribute to improved BP management.\nDeveloping the training modules was challenging due to the availability of multiple hypertension guidelines .

The director had worked with the practices and providers on previous studies, and so her pre-existing relationships aided recruitment and troubleshooting of operational issues.

We mailed potential study patients a brief description of the study and followed the mailing with a telephone invitation to attend a group-screening visit at the MVAHCS. Overall, 3,392 individuals were mailed an invitation to attend a group randomization class.\nAt the group screening visit we determined HbA 1c , LDL, and BP values. BP was measured using standardized procedures after the patient was seated for 5 min (3). We recorded three readings and calculated the average of the second and third readings. Individuals who consented to randomization and had one or more of their measures for HbA 1c , LDL, or BP within the study inclusion criteria (HbA 1c .9.0%, LDL .100 mg/dL, and BP .140/90 mmHg) were eligible for study participation. We also obtained the following information at the baseline visit: demographics, self report of comorbidities, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, medication use, height, weight, waist circumference, and additional laboratory values. In addition, all patients received information about diabetes, related complications, target values for BP, cholesterol, and glycemia, and medications used to treat these conditions.

Analyses were also conducted in which their last value was carried forward. We also performed a sensitivity analysis in which patients who were inappropriately randomized were removed; results did not change for any outcome (not shown). Finally, we conducted analyses based on subgroups of individuals with particular abnormalities at baseline. For example, we determined the influence of case management on glycemia and the number of diabetes medications in the subgroup of individuals who were included in the trial as a result of an HbA 1c .9.0%.\nRESULTS-We invited 3,392 patients to participate in the study. Of those, 729 individuals attended a group visit with 147 of those subsequently determined to be ineligible, because they did not have any intervention measure (BP, LDL, or HbA 1c ) beyond the threshold value. Twenty-six individuals chose not to participate, leaving 556 individuals randomized, with 278 to each group. Of randomized individuals, 7 withdrew (4 intervention vs. 3 usual care) and 10 died (5 intervention vs. 5 usual care). Nineteen individuals were randomized in error; they did not meet any of the entry criteria. These individuals all entered as they had a value at the cutoff for entry criteria but did not exceed the threshold (i.e., LDL = 100). We report results including these individuals. The final visit was completed in person by 431 patients (223 intervention vs. 208 control subjects, P = 0.13).\nAmong randomized patients 53 had an isolated elevated HbA 1c , 143 had an isolated elevated LDL, 164 had an isolated elevated BP, 151 had two measures beyond the threshold values, and 26 had abnormalities in all three measures.\nIn general, the randomized population represents a typical VA population, because the majority of individuals were older, male, and Caucasian. Baseline characteristics of randomized individuals by treatment assignment are outlined in Table . The baseline characteristics were similar for both treatment groups. The only statistically significant differences between randomized groups were that patients in the usual care group were more likely to be male (99.6 vs. 97.5%) and to have self-reported congestive heart failure (13.7 vs. 5.8%).\nA median of 15 (interquartile range [IQR] 10-21) case manager phone calls were attempted over the 1-year study period, of which 10 (IQR 6-14) were successful. There was no difference between groups in the number of VA primary care visits over the course of the study, as assessed through the medical record (median of three visits in both the intervention and control groups, Wilcoxon test P = 0.96). At the end of the study a greater number of patients assigned to the intervention group achieved the primary study outcome of having all three intervention measures under control (61 [21.9%] compared with 28 [10.1%] in the usual care group, P , 0.01) (Table ). When compared with the usual care group, a greater number of patients assigned to the intervention group achieved the individual treatment goals of HbA 1c ,8.0% (73.7 vs. 65.8%, P = 0.04) and BP ,130/ 80 mmHg (45.0 vs. 25.5%, P , 0.01), but not LDL ,100 mg/dL (57.6 vs. 55.4%, P = 0.61). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for imbalances in baseline characteristics, patients randomized to the intervention group had 2.1 greater odds of achieving control of all three risk factors compared with those randomized to usual care (95% CI 1.4-3.2).\nA secondary objective of the study was to determine whether the intervention lead to an improvement in each of the individual components included in the primary end point, among patients with an elevated baseline value for the component. Among participants who entered the study with an HbA 1c greater than 9.0% (n = 139), a greater percentage of patients achieved the goal HbA 1c in the intervention group, 30 (40.5%), compared with 16 (24.6%) in the usual care group (P = 0.047) (Table ). Similarly, among those randomized with an elevated LDL concentration (n = 290), a greater percentage of patients in the intervention group achieved the goal LDL of ,100 mg/dL compared with the usual care group (40.9 vs. 27.7%, P = 0.02). Finally, among those with an elevated BP at study entry (n = 311), a greater percentage of patients also achieved the goal BP at 1 year in the intervention group compared with the usual care group (40.6 vs. 15.9%, P , 0.01).\nUsing mean values for the individual components attenuated differences between groups. Among participants who entered the study with an elevated HbA 1c , there was a modest, nonsignificant difference in HbA 1c at 1 year (8.6% intervention vs. 9.1% usual care, P = 0.12). Similarly, there was a modest clinical difference in LDL concentration at 1 year among those entering the study with an elevated LDL (107.3 mg/dL intervention vs. 118.4 mg/dL usual care, P = 0.005). Finally, there was a significant difference in systolic BP among participants entering the study with an elevated systolic BP (133.7 mmHg intervention vs. 144.4 mmHg usual care, P , 0.001).\nParticipants in the intervention group were more likely to achieve the prespecified targets for blood glucose, lipids, and BP likely as a result of greater use of medications (Table ).\nAdverse events were similar between groups. No participant withdrew from the study as a result of an adverse event.\nThere was no difference in the rate of hospitalization or death between groups. Although the improvements in glycemia and lipids were modest, the biggest difference was observed in BP management. The observed differences were likely mediated both by enhanced lifestyle changes and a greater intensity of pharmacological treatment among those in the intervention group.", "heading": "Statistical analysis"}, {"text": "Our results are in keeping with other studies that have examined the influence of physician extenders (nurses, pharmacists, or others) on improving risk factors for adverse outcomes among individuals with diabetes (5-13). Shojania et al. demonstrated in a meta-analysis involving 58 trials that case managers were more effective at improving glycemic control (mean decrease in HbA 1c 0.42%) compared with usual care. This effect was particularly evident among individuals with baseline HbA 1c .8.0% (decrease in HbA 1c 0.54%). The effect of case management appears to be greater in studies where case managers directly altered medications (decrease in HbA 1c 0.96%).\nA recent study suggested that telemonitoring of patients in addition to case management offered greater control of HbA 1c compared with case management only . This may be the result of improved efficiency at contacting patients. Anecdotally, case managers reported difficulties in contacting patients to obtain selfmonitoring data (i.e., BP or glucose values), which may be overcome with periodic, automated transmission of data to the case managers .\nSimilar benefits to case management have been demonstrated for hypertension control among patients with and without diabetes. A recent meta-analysis suggested that case management was associated with greater odds of having controlled hypertension . Similar to studies targeting hyperglycemia, the magnitude of the benefit associated with case management was greater when a treatment algorithm was used (additional reduction of systolic BP of 9.4 mmHg).\nOverall, previous studies suggest that case management with a physician extender is effective at reducing either HbA 1c or BP. Few studies have used case managers to control LDL, all with generally modest effects, similar to our study results. It is unclear why our study had only a modest effect on lipids, but one possibility is that individuals recruited for study participation because of an LDL .100 mg/dL had previously failed statin therapy because of adverse effects and refused reintroduction of a statin. A post hoc review of the electronic medical record suggested that 44/275 (16%) patients with a baseline LDL .100 mg/dL had a documented adverse reaction to previous use of statins. The available evidence suggests that use of a treatment algorithm with direct modification of therapy by the physician extenders is more effective than having the extender recommend changes to the primary care provider, likely overcoming the clinical inertia often experienced by clinicians .\nIndividuals with diabetes do not typically have an abnormality in only glycemic control, but also frequently have hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Data from NHANES 2003-2006 suggest that 76% also have hypertension and 55% have hyperlipidemia (1). In the most recent NHANES survey, rates of control for hypertension (BP ,130/80 mmHg), hyperlipidemia (LDL ,100 mg/dL), and hyperglycemia (HbA 1c ,7.0%) were 45.2, 46.6, and 57%. However, simultaneous control of all three measures was poor at only 12.2%. Although previous studies have suggested that case management is effective at improving control of individual risk factors, case management of isolated abnormalities is likely not sufficient, given the common occurrence of multiple cardiovascular risk factor abnormalities in patients with diabetes. Very few studies have used case managers to target more than one risk factor in patients with diabetes . The Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) study was a large randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention consisting of case management and telemonitoring against usual care in 1,665 individuals with diabetes . This study demonstrated a small benefit to case management on three domains (HbA 1c , 20.29%; LDL, 23.84 mg/dL; systolic BP, 24.32 mmHg). A possible reason for the small effect sizes observed in this study was that the case managers were not able to change medications directly but had to notify primary care providers about abnormalities, which may have delayed therapy as a result of clinical inertia. Our study was similar to that of the IDEATel, but with a significantly greater treatment effect, which is likely a result of direct intervention by the physician extenders through the use of a treatment algorithm. Given that the majority of individuals with diabetes have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, strategies that target single factors are likely to have reduced benefit compared with those that target multiple risk factors. It is likely unfeasible for patients with diabetes to have multiple case managers because this would likely lead to confusion and extra costs and be onerous for both the patients and the primary care providers. Our results suggest that nurse case managers can effectively enhance the rate of control among individuals with diabetes for three cardiovascular risk factors combined and individually.\nOur study has a number of limitations. First, we inadvertently randomized a number of individuals inappropriately because they were at the threshold of our inclusion criteria, but did not formally meet our criteria for inclusion (i.e., systolic BP equal to 140 mmHg, not greater than 140 mmHg). We performed intent-to-treat analysis where these individuals were maintained in all outcome measurespreserving randomization. We also conducted sensitivity analyses, in which these individuals were excluded, with no change in any of our results. Although our overall intervention demonstrated a benefit, it is unclear what component of our intervention resulted in the benefit, because we could not evaluate each component separately as designed. It appears that after 1 year, individuals in the intervention group who had baseline hypertension, hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia were on a greater number of medications for these disorders compared with usual care patients. We did not assess medication adherence or changes in dietary patterns, although these were reinforced at every nurse call over the course of the year. As such, we can only conclude that the strategy of case management, including frequent contact, lifestyle modification encouragement, and medication intensification, leads to improved outcomes at 1 year compared with usual care. Other limitations to our study include the few women and minorities enrolled, typical of the VA population. Finally, although our primary outcome was improved, the outcomes we chose are all surrogate measures, and it is unclear if case management would reduce the number of clinical adverse outcomes.\nThere are a number of strengths to our study. First, we had a fairly large sample size of individuals with minimal exclusion criteria, enhancing the generalizability of our study. Our study was powered to detect a difference in achieving three cardiovascular risk factors as opposed to just a single factor, enhancing acceptability of the intervention by patients and likely reducing the overall cost of the intervention, although we did not conduct a formal cost effectiveness analysis.\nOverall, our results demonstrate that nurse case managers can enhance the care provided to individuals with diabetes. Specifically, use of nurse case managers can improve the percentage of individuals with diabetes attaining control of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Case management appears to be effective in managing a number of cardiovascular risk factors concurrently in patients with diabetes.", "heading": "CONCLUSIONS-Our results demonstrate that involving a nurse case manager in the care of patients with diabetes can"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

A random effects model in Stata:16 software was used for the meta-analysis.\n\nResults\nUltimately, 68 articles were included in the study. Interventions were effective in 54 studies and ineffective in 14 studies. Meta-analysis results of 34 studies showed that the interventions reduced the mean systolic blood pressure by 7.26 mmHg [5.32-9.2, CI = 95%] and diastolic blood pressure by 2.77 mmHg [1.81-3.73, CI = 95%]. Overall, interventions conducted in low-and middle-income countries, in healthcare centers, as single-component interventions, and with fewer repetition periods were more effective. Meta-regression results indicated that the variables of patient follow-up duration (weeks) and the frequency of intervention (weeks) did not predict the outcomes of interventions on changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The heterogeneity of study results was high, but the likelihood of publication bias was very low.\n\nConclusion\nDue to the significant effectiveness of community-based interventions in preventing and controlling hypertension, the development and implementation of additional such interventions are strongly recommended.", "sections": {"list": [{"text": "Hypertension is one of the most common diseases worldwide and a significant public health issue. More than half of coronary artery diseases and two-thirds of strokes and heart failure are directly attributed to hypertension . In 2000, the total number of adults with hypertension was estimated at 972 million, with 333 million in economically developed countries and 639 million in economically developing countries. This number is predicted to increase by approximately 60% to a total of 1.56 billion by 2025 . The consequences of uncontrolled hypertension are extensive, accounting for 7.6 million premature deaths globally (about 13.5% of the total), 54% of strokes, 47% of ischemic heart diseases, and 92 million disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) .\nIn 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the theme for World Health Day as \"Measure your blood pressure, reduce your risk, \" calling for more serious efforts to prevent and control high blood pressure . Clinical trials have shown that controlling blood pressure reduces the incidence of strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure . Optimal blood pressure control reduces therapeutic outcomes and public health costs related to its complications . Although hypertension is easily detectable and treatable, it remains the leading cause of death worldwide compared to other cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, obesity, and lipid disorders .\nDespite hypertension being a major global concern and its management leading to healthcare cost savings, less than 25% of hypertensive patients achieve global disease control targets . Some studies suggest that suboptimal blood pressure control can result from low patient awareness and understanding, non-adherence to prescribed medications, and poor lifestyle choices, including diet, sedentary behavior, and obesity . Other studies report that many hypertensive individuals remain undiagnosed, and among those diagnosed, many continue with unhealthy lifestyles that do not help improve blood pressure . Therefore, increasing knowledge and awareness about hypertension and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle can significantly impact blood pressure control and patient life . Healthcare professionals should not only identify and treat hypertensive patients but also promote healthy lifestyles and preventive strategies to reduce the prevalence of hypertension in the general population .\nCurrent recommendations for preventing and treating high blood pressure emphasize lifestyle modifications . Effective lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure include weight loss, reduced sodium intake, increased physical activity, limited alcohol consumption, and a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products . Researchers have examined the impact of education and healthy lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise) on blood pressure control. Educational intervention programs have been associated with improved patient knowledge, awareness, adherence to antihypertensive medications, and the adoption of healthier lifestyle choices, leading to effective blood pressure control and overall quality of life improvement .\nIn recent years, recognizing the importance and impact of community-based interventions, many studies have been conducted to prevent and control hypertension. Community-based interventions for hypertension control and prevention involve engaging local communities in hypertension prevention and control efforts through health education, regular screening, and referral to health centers. These interventions aim to raise awareness, increase access to care, and promote self-management, and may be delivered in a variety of accessible settings in the community, including primary health care centers . Since these interventions were developed and executed in diverse ways, yielding varied outcomes, conducting a systematic review of their characteristics and results can provide valuable insights for designing and implementing more effective interventions. Additionally, one of the best ways to understand existing evidence and the success rate after implementation is through systematic review studies. A systematic review is a study with a comprehensive design and detailed strategy that aims to reduce bias by identifying, critiquing, and synthesizing all articles in a specific field. Based on initial searches, it appears that no comprehensive study has systematically summarized and evaluated community-based interventions for hypertension prevention and control.

The interventions primarily included health education, lifestyle changes, increased physical activity, and dietary improvements. Significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in hypertension control initiatives.\nSubgroup analysis results showed that communitybased interventions had varying effects on reducing mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in countries with different income levels. However, given that the effectiveness of interventions was observed in both high and low-middle-income countries, these differences can optimistically be attributed to the widespread recognition of the importance of blood pressure prevention and control in health systems worldwide. Despite this, the experiences of other countries should not be overlooked, and low-and middle-income countries can bridge the gap by adopting and localizing the experiences of highincome countries, improving the quality of designed interventions to enhance their effectiveness. When adopting and using the intervention methods and models implemented in high-income countries, it is essential to consider the social, economic, cultural differences, and the quality of interventions. Without attention to these differences, adoption of these interventions will not be effective, thus, existing differences must be taken into account .\nAccording to subgroup analysis results, interventions conducted in healthcare settings were more effective compared to those conducted in community settings and workplaces. This difference in effectiveness could be due to greater access to resources and expertise in healthcare environments. In these settings, individuals have access to physicians and specialists with deeper knowledge and advanced equipment, allowing for more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of blood pressure issues. Additionally, the continuous monitoring and follow-up in healthcare settings may contribute to this . These results emphasize the importance of strengthening and expanding access to specialized healthcare and suggest that for effectively reducing blood pressure in the population, a combination of community-based and specialized healthcare interventions is necessary.\nThe study review showed that of the 68 studies, 49 were designed for controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension, with approximately 81.43% of the interventions being effective. In empowering patients for selfcare, it is important to simultaneously educate patients on how to monitor their lifestyle and self-care process, integrating self-care with self-awareness and patient empowerment to facilitate behavioral changes and improve their lifestyle . Despite the importance of controlling blood pressure in patients, it should not be forgotten that preventive measures can always reduce future care and treatment costs. In this regard, health systems can use their coordinating and leadership roles to identify and assess the needs of various target groups using community resources, and design appropriate interventions based on the economic, social, and cultural conditions of each group. By removing barriers to access, optimal use of health facilities for communitybased interventions for blood pressure prevention and control can be achieved .\nThe study results showed that most interventions were educational, which were less effective compared to lifestyle modification and dietary interventions. The barriers to the effectiveness of these interventions might include communication barriers in content delivery, using outdated methods for information transfer, one-way communication, and lack of active participant engagement. Therefore, by designing integrated and motivational educational interventions, the predicted goals can be . Subgroup meta-analysis data showed that singledimensional interventions were more effective in reducing blood pressure compared to multi-dimensional interventions. Single-dimensional interventions might be simpler to implement and easier for patients and healthcare providers to follow due to their focus on a specific factor. Specific interventions like educational programs focused on medication adherence or a specific diet can directly improve patient compliance with treatment and thus reduce blood pressure. On the other hand, multi-dimensional interventions, which include broader changes like combining diet, exercise, psychological counseling, and extensive education, may be more complex and harder to implement. Studies conducted in Latin America [101], China [102], and India [103] have shown that interventions focused solely on healthcare providers, such as hypertension management workshops and educational sessions facilitated by nurses, have significantly improved blood pressure outcomes. These interventions led to increased adherence to antihypertensive medications, improved blood pressure control rates, and increased knowledge and positive attitudes towards hypertension prevention and management. However, multi-dimensional interventions still play a crucial role in the long-term management of blood pressure and overall patient health. While single-dimensional interventions might be more effective in the short term, comprehensive and multi-dimensional approaches are needed for sustainable results and overall improvement in patient quality of life. These approaches, supported appropriately, can gradually create positive and lasting changes in patients' lifestyles .\nAlthough this study aimed to provide comprehensive and transparent information for decision-makers and healthcare providers, especially in the area of blood pressure, by identifying, extracting, quantitatively analyzing (meta-analysis and meta-regression), and fully interpreting the results, the present study had several major limitations that should be considered when interpreting and using the study results. One of the most significant limitations was restricting searches to English-language studies. If results from studies published in other languages were included in the analyses, the results might differ. Other limitation was that due to high heterogeneity in intervention characteristics, it was not possible to accumulate them without considering these variables, limiting the number of variables included in the metaanalysis to changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, conducting a meta-analysis of outcomes such as behavioral changes, shifts in public awareness, and similar factors was not feasible. Researchers are encouraged to undertake systematic reviews and targeted meta-analyses to assess the effectiveness of communitybased interventions in enhancing these outcomes.\nAnother limitation of this study is that only published studies from peer-reviewed journals were included in the meta-analysis. This decision was made to ensure the quality and reliability of the effect sizes, as studies published in peer-reviewed journals are generally considered to have undergone rigorous evaluation. However, future research could benefit from including unpublished trials and grey literature to further reduce potential publication bias and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention's effectiveness.", "heading": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The study results demonstrated that interventions reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Subgroup analyses revealed that the greatest reduction in mean systolic blood pressure occurred in middle-and low-income countries within healthcare settings, where single-dimensional interventions were implemented. The largest reduction in mean diastolic blood pressure was observed in upper-middle-income countries within healthcare settings. These findings confirm the importance of structured and targeted interventions in healthcare settings for controlling blood pressure, while also highlighting the role of healthcare facilities as platforms for delivering community-based interventions in certain contexts. To strengthen these efforts, policymakers and practitioners should prioritize integrating educational campaigns, promoting lifestyle and dietary changes, and utilizing healthcare settings as delivery platforms to reach underserved populations.", "heading": "Conclusion"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

Although home health nurses are uniquely positioned to help vulnerable individuals achieve BP control, hypertension (HTN) management has not been a high priority in post-acute care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of two home-based interventions designed to improve BP outcomes among high-risk African-American patients. DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 845 newly admitted patients with uncontrolled HTN (JNC7 stages 1 or 2).\n\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe \"basic\" intervention delivered key HTN information to clinicians and patients, and a home BP monitor to patients, while the patients received usual post-acute care. The \"augmented\" intervention provided more intensive and extensive HTN information, monitoring and feedback for 3 months beyond the index home care admission. MEASURES: Primary: BP control. Secondary: reductions in mmHG SBP and DBP, improvements in proportions improving JNC7 stage or achieving clinically meaningful reductions in SBP and DBP. METHODS: Multivariate regression models. KEY RESULTS: The basic intervention produced no significant BP improvements; the augmented intervention significantly improved stage 2 patients' outcomes. Among stage 2 patients, the augmented intervention increased BP control by 8.7 percentage points relative to usual care (8.9% vs. 17.6%; p= 0.01), yielded an 8.3 mmHG relative reduction in SBP (p=0.01), and increased the proportion achieving at least a 20 mmHG reduction in SBP by 16.4 percentage points (p=0.01).

Moreover, the death rate from uncontrolled HTN is nearly three times as high among blacks as whites .\nThis paper reports on results of a three-arm communitylocated randomized controlled trial (RCT), which builds on earlier studies showing that multifaceted interventions with reminder systems and team-based care hold promise for improving BP control .

Change in HTN stage was selected as an outcome because JNC7 treatment recommendations vary by BP stage. Achievement of a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP or DBP was selected because each increment of 20 mmHg in SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP has been estimated to double the risk of CVD across a wide BP range .\nTwo measures of cost also were examined: (1) intervention, home care, and outpatient costs, and (2) overall health carerelated costs, which included, in addition to intervention and outpatient costs directly affected by the intervention, resource costs associated with patient's self-reported use of hospital and emergency department (ED) services during the study period.

In all models, robust standard errors were computed to account for design clustering. Given that randomization occurred at the nurse rather than at the patient-level, in addition to group membership, all multivariate analyses controlled for characteristics that might influence patient assignment to a specific nurse or confound the relationship between interventions and patient-level outcomes. These included: patient age>65 years old and poverty status, as proxied by Medicaid enrollment; baseline measures of patient's comorbidity, diagnosis of diabetes, systolic and diastolic BP; as well as an indicator of hospitalization in the 2 weeks preceding home health admission, borough of residence, and the nurse's caseload.

The augmented intervention, however, did result in significant relative improvements among patients with stage 2 HTN at baseline. These patients were significantly more likely to achieve BP control than usual care patients (16% vs 10%, p<0.05). In addition, their mean SBP was significantly lower at 3 months relative to usual care stage 2 patients (-8 mmHg, p<0.05).\nTable reports the regression-adjusted effects of the interventions on patients' primary outcome (HTN control) and all secondary outcomes (SBP and DBP, improving HTN stage, and experiencing a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP or DBP). Relative to usual care, the basic intervention demonstrated no significant improvements in patient outcomes overall or by HTN severity, nor did the augmented intervention result in statistically significant improvements for the entire sample relative to usual care, despite marginally significant relative improvements for several outcomes.\nIn contrast, among JNC7 stage 2 patients, the augmented intervention resulted in superior outcomes for all but one outcome measure (mmHG DBP). Stage 2 patients in the augmented group were 8.7 percentage points more likely than those in usual care to achieve BP control (adjusted probability=17.6% versus 8.9%, respectively, p=0.04). They also experienced a reduction of 8.3 mmHg in their systolic BP relative to usual care subjects (p = 0.01) and were significantly more likely to achieve a clinically meaningful reduction in systolic BP of 20 or more mmHg relative to their baseline levels (+16.4 percentage points, p=0.01). Although less precisely estimated, the proportion of stage 2 patients experiencing clinically meaningful reductions in diastolic BP was 9.6 percentage points (or 29%) greater in the augmented group relative to usual care group subjects (p =0.10). Finally, stage 2 patients in the augmented group also were more likely than those in the usual care group to experience reductions in BP consistent with improved HTN stage (10.5 percentage points, p=0.09). This improvement represented a 28% gain over usual care patients during the 3-month period.\nOf the control variables included in the analyses, only baseline BP, a diagnosis of diabetes and age were consistently significant across outcomes. Regardless of intervention group, the higher the person's baseline BP was, the greater the likelihood of experiencing a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP or DBP, but the lower the likelihood of actually achieving BP control.

However, once inpatient and ED use costs were taken into account, differences between groups were small and not statistically significant, suggesting lower use of more costly, hospital-based services among treatment groups when compared to usual care subjects.

The study demonstrated that the nurse-led intervention, providing additional medication review and patient self-management support during the 3-month post-acute care period, significantly improved BP control in a high-risk, low income black population admitted to care with JNC7 stage 2 HTN. Relative to usual care, the augmented intervention dramatically increased the probability of 3-month BP control (17.6 vs 8.9% adjusted control) among stage 2 patients. The augmented intervention also yielded an 8.3-mmHg relative reduction in SBP and a 29% relative increase in the proportion of stage 2 patients achieving at least a 20 mmHg reduction in SBP.\nThe findings are particularly important given the HTN-related risk profile of the study population, all uncontrolled at baseline. National data show that BP control is especially problematic for blacks, women, persons aged 70 and over, individuals with diabetes, and those who have less than a high school education . In this black study population, approximately a fifth were 75 or older , 42% had less than a high school education, 45% had an annual income of $10,000 or less, 53% were JNC7 stage 2 at baseline, and 59% had diabetes. Our study thus focused on a much higher risk population than previous HTN interventions.\nThe finding of significant intervention effects solely among patients with severe uncontrolled HTN, although disappointing, is not surprising. The majority of community-based HTN intervention trials enroll provider and/or patient volunteers , who may be more focused on or motivated to achieve BP control than participants in our study. Second, evidence suggests considerable provider inertia in adjusting BP medications among patients with lower disease severity . Third, patients themselves may be less adherent to medications and more reluctant to seek adjustment or adopt therapeutic lifestyle changes when BP values are perceived as within an \"acceptable range\" . Our approach of examining the interventions' effectiveness by HTN severity, although initially unplanned, highlights the importance of targeting specific types of intervention to specific patient severity groups.\nThe study has several limitations. First, it is based on black patients served by a single, albeit large, home health organization providing care to an urban patient population that is poorer, less well educated, and more culturally diverse than the population typically served by post-acute home care organizations . Generalizability of findings to other groups is thus unclear. Second, randomization occurred at the nurse rather than the patient level. Third, the study was powered to discern significant effects for all uncontrolled patients, while significant outcomes were limited to the patient subgroup with stage 2 HTN. Although ideally subgroup effects would have been incorporated in the study's initial design, the baseline distribution of patients by stage was unavailable a priori and therefore could provide no guidelines for power analysis. Nevertheless, the sub-group effects were sufficiently robust to achieve statistical significance despite the smaller sample size. Lastly, the BP improvements reported here were measured at 3 months, and it is possible that the intervention's effects may have dissipated over a longer time period .\nHome health patients are an especially high-risk group characterized by multiple comorbid conditions and medications . Keeping abreast of evidence-based practices, supporting patients' adherence to physician-prescribed medication regimens and appropriate lifestyle changes, and linking patients to other medical and community resources are central to the nurse's role. However, the potential for improving HTN management for this chronically ill and costly population has not been exploited. The results reported here, however, demonstrate that augmenting home health care can significantly improve BP outcomes among black patients with severe uncontrolled HTN. The study's cost findings suggest that in the short-term, such a home-based post-acute care intervention would be cost-neutral with respect to overall (inpatient + outpatient) costs, thus providing policy-relevant information for designing and targeting future transitional care demonstrations. These findings represent the first RCT-derived evidence estimating the effects of a transitional care intervention for post-acute home care patients otherwise at risk of \"slipping through\" the system with suboptimal BP management.", "heading": "DISCUSSION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

There is growing recognition that the archetype of the lone physician caring for patients in a 15-min clinic visit cannot meet the chronic care needs of our aging US population. According to one study, meeting the chronic, preventive, and acute needs of a panel of 2,500 patients requires 21.7 h per working day . In a feasibility study of collaborative goal-setting, physicians report time constraints as a barrier to key chronic illness counseling activities . Lone physicians simply do not have time to provide optimal care of chronic illness. In contrast, the use of multidisciplinary teams in chronic disease care is associated with increased delivery of self-management support .\nBuilding multidisciplinary teams in a primary care setting, however, is challenging, particularly in academic health centers. Highly functioning teams require consistency so that team members work together to build roles and enhance communication . Academic clinics are staffed by part-time trainees who follow varied schedules and may have difficulty establishing continuity with patients or sustaining relationships with other health care team members. To create chronic care teams, academic clinics often rely on specialized clinics focusing on specific conditions rather than fully integrating such care into general primary care. This approach may erode the integrative function of primary care and detract from continuity in primary care training programs.\nAn alternative approach, the Teamlet Model, embeds chronic care teams within primary care practices. The Teamlet Model, which has been previously described in detail , proposes a small team-the dyad of a clinician with a medical assistant or health worker-that collaborates to provide care. In this model, medical assistants or health workers are trained as health coaches who work collaboratively with patients and clinicians to help patients manage their own conditions within the context of their daily lives. Specifically, health coaches help patients Funded in part by the California HealthCare Foundation 08-1523 and the California Academic Chronic Care Collaborative. build the information, skills, and confidence needed to reach their own health goals. They also provide emotional support and practical assistance needed by many patients living with chronic illnesses.\nDuring the California Academic Chronic Care Collaborative, we developed, implemented, and evaluated the Teamlet Model for chronic illness care in an academic primary care setting with the intent of disseminating the model, if successful, to other teaching clinics. We evaluated clinical outcomes as well as resident physician and staff satisfaction with team and patient communication. In this paper, we report only patient outcomes associated with the Teamlet Model and will describe resident and staff experience elsewhere.", "heading": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Aims. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Teamlet Model on care of patients with diabetes and/or hypertension in a primary care residency practice. We compared measurement of body mass index (BMI), assessment of smoking status, development of a self-management plan, testing for HbA1C and LDL, and reaching goals for blood pressure, HbA1C, and LDL in the intervention group prior to and during implementation of the Teamlet Model. We also compared changes in testing for HbA1C and LDL and reaching goals for blood pressure, HbA1C, and LDL in the intervention group to changes seen in a comparison group of similar patients at the same clinic. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).\nSetting. The San Francisco General Hospital Family Health Center (FHC), a family medicine teaching clinic, is the largest primary care clinic within the San Francisco Community Health Network, serving more than 10,000 active patients. The patient population is racially and ethnically diverse (39% Latino, 27% Asian, 17% White, 13% African American), with 83% uninsured or covered by Medicaid. Patients speak 29 different languages: most common are English (42%), Spanish (25%), and Cantonese/Mandarin (8%). The FHC is the primary ambulatory training site for the 41 resident trainees in the UCSF Family and Community Medicine Residency Program.\nParticipants. One hundred forty-six active patients who (1) transferred from graduating third year residents to incoming first year residents, (2) had at least one visit in the previous 2 years, (3) spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin, and 4) were diagnosed with diabetes and/or hypertension. This cohort was identified after elimination through attrition (27 patients moved, transferred care, died, or became inactive) or refusal (7 patients). Patients with severe mental illness or dementia were excluded.\nComparison Group Patients. A comparison group of 395 patients was constructed of all FHC patients who (1) had second and third year resident providers, (2) had at least one visit in the last 2 years, (3) spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin, and (4) were diagnosed with diabetes and/or hypertension.\nProgram Description. In 2006, the Teamlet Model was piloted on a small scale at the FHC . Building upon the pilot, during the 2007-8 academic year, we expanded the Teamlet Model to 13 first-year residents, 11 health coaches, and approximately 150 patients. This implementation coincided with our participation in the California Academic Chronic Care Collaborative, a practice improvement collaborative involving teaching clinics throughout California.In early 2007, all FHC nursing staff, including medical assistants and health workers, participated in health coach training. In contrast to medical assistants, health workers in our system have training in patient education, but no clinical training. The training encompassed collaborative partnership with patients , action plans for healthy behavior change , medication adherence, and an overview of cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes. Training required active participation through role-plays to develop skills in behavior-change action plan negotiation, medication reconciliation, and patientcentered communication . The health coach training curriculum is available at . After six initial training sessions, the FHC medical director and nurse manager assigned all available medical assistants and health workers (11 in total) to be health coaches. Ongoing training involved live observations, mentoring, and case discussions to further build patient communication skills. Total training time ranged from 14-16 h, and competency was determined through direct observation by the trainers.\nAn interactive seminar series was designed for 13 PGY1 residents, covering the Chronic Care Model with specific sessions on clinical guidelines and evidence, self-management support, the use of registry data, community resources, and patient perspectives on living with chronic illness. Seminars included protected time for teamlets to review their patient panels, using registry reports as tools for panel management .\nTraining continued during clinical practice as faculty observed the resident-coach teamlets and provided feedback on both team and patient communication.\nAll PGY1s had continuity clinic at the same time, allowing them to work with a consistent group of faculty who only supervised PGY1s during that time. During the Teamlet Model intervention, chronic care clinics were held within the regular PGY1 clinic afternoons once or twice a month. For these intervention clinics, the 13 PGY1 residents and 11 health coaches were paired in language-concordant teams. These teamlets were stable: residents and patients always worked with the same health coach. Four to six patients with chronic cardiovascular risk factors were scheduled during each clinic session. Teamlets and supervising faculty huddled during the first 30 min of clinic, discussing scheduled patients and prioritizing higher risk patients for coaching.\nThe health coaches expanded the physician visit with a pre-visit for agenda-setting and medication reconciliation, and a post-visit to engage patients in behavior-change action plans and to check patient understanding and agreement with the clinician's care plan. In addition, health coaches called patients between visits to follow-up on action plans and medication adherence and to help patients problem-solve and navigate the health care system. Teamlets chose to apply all or parts of this delivery model to individual patients based on time and prioritization of patients who were more complicated or needed more assistance. Health coaches generally saw two to four patients during each clinic.\nMeasures. Data prior to and during the intervention were used to assess changes in process and outcome measures, and to compare changes to a similar group of patients who did not receive the intervention. Three clinical processes were assessed for teamlet patients only (measurement of BMI, assessment of smoking status, and formulation of a self-management plan) by chart review prior to the intervention and at the time of each visit during the intervention year. Two clinical processes (measurement of HbA1C and LDL) and three clinical outcomes (HgbA1C, LDL, and blood pressure) were assessed for both Teamlet Model and comparison group patients for the year prior to implementation of the Teamlet Model (February 2006 to January 2007) and during the implementation year (July 2007 to June 2008) from electronic medical records (HbA1C and LDL) and by hand review of patient charts by research assistants (blood pressure). Variability of blood pressure measurements was not controlled as values were gathered from clinical chart review. If more than one value was available for any given measure in a 1-year window, then the most recent value was used.\nData Analysis. Key patient characteristics were compared for patients in the intervention and comparison groups using chisquare and t-tests. Process outcomes were all dichotomous variables (measurement of BMI, assessment of smoking status, formulation of a self-management plan, and measurement of LDL or HbA1C in the past 12 months). Clinical outcomes (HbA1C, LDL, and blood pressure) were coded dichotomously based on commonly used 'at goal' values as follows: HbA1c <7.0, BP (<130/80 for diabetes patients; <140/90 for hypertension patients), and LDL (<100 for diabetes patients; <130 for hypertension patients). To examine change in the proportion of patients meeting health outcome goals prior to the intervention compared to the intervention year, McNemar tests were conducted within the intervention and comparison groups. Changes in process and outcomes from the year prior to the year during implementation of the Teamlet Model were assessed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline values of outcomes and, in a separate model, for baseline values and patient characteristics (age, gender, language, and diagnosis).

Improvements in clinical outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Table also compares changes in the proportion of patients from baseline to follow-up in the Teamlet Model versus the comparison group. The Teamlet Model group had larger increases in the proportion of patients with measured HbA1C, and at-goal blood pressure, HbA1C, and LDL, though these differences did not reach statistical significance. Further adjusting for age, gender, language, and diagnosis gave virtually identical results. While the proportion of patients who had their LDL measured increased in both the Teamlet Model and comparison group patients, this increase was significantly greater in the comparison group.\nOverall productivity for first year residents was not affected, averaging 146 patient visits during the year compared to 136 for the previous residency class. Tracking the number and content of health coach interactions with patients was beyond the scope of this evaluation.", "heading": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "This project demonstrated that resident physicians and health coaches can work together with patients in a collaborative manner within an academic practice. The logistical difficulties of scheduling patients, physicians, and coaches to allow meaningful pre-visits, visits, and post-visits were largely overcome by taking advantage of predictable PGY1 clinic schedules and by ensuring that health coach staff had no competing demands during chronic care clinics. Health coaches, as full-time staff, offered continuity for their patients, helping patients gain access to their physicians and navigate a complex medical system.\nThe Teamlet Model may improve patient care within academic practices. The impact of the intervention on clinical processes and outcomes was mixed. Teamlet patients showed improvement in all five targeted clinical processes and three clinical outcomes. This improvement was significant in four of the five processes and was marginally significant in one of the outcomes (LDL at goal, p=0.07). While the proportion of patients with measured HbA1C and HbA1C, LDL, and blood pressure at-goal increased more among teamlet patients than in the comparison group, these differences did not reach statistical significance, though the difference for blood pressure at goal was marginally significant (p=0.06). One process, measurement of LDL, increased significantly more in the comparison group than in the intervention group. There are notable limitations in this study. The use of a comparison patient group of similar patients with resident providers within the same clinic allows for a more rigorous evaluation of the Teamlet Model than is possible with a simple 'before and after' comparison. However, patients in the comparison group differed from the intervention patients-they were more likely to have a sole diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension and received care from upper level resident physicians with more training and familiarity with the clinic. These differences may have contributed to the negative result of this evaluation. There was also potential contamination between the groups. Two upper level residents who cared for patients in the comparison group participated in the 2006 Teamlet Model pilot and helped teach PGY1s in the seminar series. Also, one third of the PGY1 clinic faculty regularly supervised upper level residents on other days in the clinic, potentially spreading core concepts and practices from the Teamlet Model. Nursing staff, although acting as health coaches only during PGY1 clinics, interacted regularly with all clinic patients as medical assistants and health workers. The comparison patient group improved in all three outcomes, including an unexpectedly large increase in the proportion having LDL measured. This may reflect concurrent efforts at quality improvement in the clinic or a halo effect on the comparison group from the intervention.\nThe lack of significant difference in outcomes between teamlet patients and the comparison group has several additional possible explanations. The study had sufficient power (at the conventional level of 0.80) to detect a true difference of about 14% between groups; therefore, a more modest but clinically meaningful difference may have been missed. Second, the 1-year duration of the current study may not have been sufficient to show clinical outcome improvement-other studies in chronic disease care improvement initiatives focusing on safety net populations, for example the Health Disparities Collaborative, initially showed process measure improvement only; outcome measures did not improve until repeat evaluation 2 to 3 years later . Third, as a quality improvement program, the implementation of the model underwent rapid cycle changes during the year, and the resident-coach teamlets evolved over the course of the year. Finally, we did not measure how much each patient was exposed to teamlet coaching; the dose of the intervention may not have been sufficient to maximize its potential, and we were unable to look for a dose effect in our analyses.\nA number of lessons were learned from this project. Medical assistants can play an active role in patient care as health coaches, to an extent that has not previously been described in the literature. Only one previous primary care study, a recent trial from Germany that enrolled patients with depression from 74 small community practices , describes using medical assistants as health coaches. Less intensive than the Teamlet Model, the health coaches in the German study called patients monthly and reported to the primary care physician, but did not participate in clinic visits.\nStability of teamlet pairings optimized continuity of care for patients and team communication. By defining a new interactive role, health coaching can engage medical assistants and health workers who are consistently in clinic, often language and culturally concordant with patients, and insightful about patients' daily lives. Such expanded roles can increase staff satisfaction as health care team members.\nWe found that some clinic staff members are not interested or appropriate to assume the Teamlet Model coaching role, a role requiring a high degree of empathy, communication skills, and ability to work in partnership with patients and training physicians. Even though the health coaches received substantial training, some were not ready to work effectively with patients and residents. The Teamlet Model works best if coaches can be carefully selected, well-trained, and observed while interacting with patients, with feedback and protected time to focus on health coaching without competing demands.\nThe project offers insight into the process and outcomes of a quality improvement program focusing on expanded team roles within an academic primary care practice. Active participation and support from departmental leadership were fundamental to implementing and sustaining this intervention. Inclusion of frontline clinic staff members and residents in the planning and implementation of the project has encouraged team-based care to spread within the Family Health Center.\nThese lessons allowed us to make significant changes in the health coaching program to improve the teamlets at the conclusion of this project. We identified a subset of staff who were very motivated in their coaching work. We now have a small number of full-time or almost full-time health coaches working with all residents as well as faculty physicians.", "heading": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The Teamlet Model is a tool to build health care teams that can improve chronic disease care in academic primary care practices.

The predicted mismatch between physician supply and patient demand is heavily influenced by the aging US population and the increased burden of chronic illness. Although some experts call for an increase in medical school admissions, others suggest this solution perpetuates past healthcare delivery design and ignores the opportunity to reconfigure the system based on the needs of the future. Specifically, Greenberg, et al. suggest that care of the aging population with widespread chronic illness should rely on coordination of care between physicians and non-physician healthcare professionals to facilitate improved disease management. However, there is a paucity of large, multi-site, randomized controlled studies assessing the value of allied healthcare professionals to help inform healthcare redesign.\nHypertension is an appropriate target for team-based disease management based on its high prevalence (affects 50 million Americans) and poor disease control (66% of patients fail to achieve a target <140/90 mmHg). Although papers describing the potential role of clinical pharmacists in the care of hypertension date back more than 30 years, 7 this approach has not been widely disseminated outside of closed delivery systems, such as the Veterans Administration. Optimal management of hypertension relies on patient education, encouragement of self-management and lifestyle modification, use of antihypertensive agents and blood pressure monitoring. When patients do not reach target blood pressure, regular follow-up with a vigorous stepped approach to antihyperten-sive therapy is recommended. These elements of hypertension management are within the scope and training of all Doctors of Pharmacy completing accredited residency training in primary care. A systematic review evaluating pharmacists in expanded patient care roles found improved outcomes in chronic health conditions, including hypertension. The purpose of this study was to address important evidence gaps by assessing the impact of co-located physician-pharmacist team-based care on blood pressure control, quality of life and patient satisfaction in patients cared for by all physicians practicing in multiple community-based clinics over a 1-year period.", "heading": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "This study was a 12-month, single-blind, randomized, controlled study, approved by the organizational institutional review board.\nStudy Site and Population. The study was conducted within the Providence Primary Care Research Network in Oregon, which is part of a not-for-profit integrated delivery system. All Network community-based primary care clinics were included (n=9), with the exception of academic teaching clinics (n=4). Participating clinics comprised approximately 80 physicians caring for 110,000 patients of mixed insurance status.\nTo identify candidates with known hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure, the Network's electronic medical record (EMR) database was queried (February 2000) for patients with an office visit within the past 2 years, a problem list entry of hypertension (ICD-9 of 410.*), and a last systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg and/or a last diastolic blood pressure \u2265100 mmHg. Patients with mildly uncontrolled blood pressure (140-159/90-99 mmHg) were offered participation in a parallel study evaluating mailed patient self-management materials (data published elsewhere). Subjects were excluded if there was no blood pressure reading in the chart in the previous 2 years, they had attended a visit with a pharmacy practitioner in the previous 6 months, or they had transferred care out of the Network.\nAll eligible candidates received a mailed invitation for participation. Interested candidates provided consent by return postcard or phone. At the time consent was received by research staff, subjects were randomly assigned, with equal allocation and without restrictions, to intervention or control using a computer-generated random sequence. Based on the nature of the intervention, participant blinding was not possible. All subjects were mailed hypertension educational materials in order to assure similar baseline awareness of hypertension self-management principles between groups.\nIntervention. Subjects allocated to usual care were instructed to continue their normal schedule of medical care. The primary care physician was also provided a list of subjects allocated to usual care. Out of concern, subjects with an entry BP\u2265180/ 110 mmHg, based on last measurement in the EMR, were scheduled for an appointment with their primary care provider if a future appointment did not already exist.\nSubjects allocated to the intervention were scheduled for an appointment in their primary care clinic with any one of five Network-employed pharmacy practitioners. Each pharmacist had a post-baccalaureate doctor of pharmacy degree, 1 to 2 years of ambulatory medicine residency training, and was board certified in pharmacotherapy. No additional training was provided in preparation for this study. During the initial visit, pharmacists described the physician-pharmacist collaborative model of care. Consistent with Network-approved collaborative hypertension management guidelines, the pharmacists reviewed subjects' medications and lifestyle habits, assessed vital signs, screened for adverse drug reactions, identified barriers to adherence, provided education, optimized the antihypertensive regimen, and scheduled follow-up appointments as judged necessary. Antihypertensive regimen optimization included alterations in antihypertensive regimens to titrate the dose of an existing medication, add a new agent, switch a medication, or consolidate antihypertensive therapy. The pharmacist had access to patients' medical records to assist medication selection and dosing, as well as access to the primary care physician (PCP) to discuss the hypertension treatment plan or other medical issues as needed. Following each interaction, a note was documented in the EMR and forwarded to the PCP for approval and co-signature.", "heading": "METHODS"}, {"text": "Clinical. The primary outcome was the difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the team-based care arm (intervention) and the usual care arm (control) at study end. Effectiveness of hypertension management was also evaluated as the proportion of subjects in each group achieving a target blood pressure <140/90 mmHg. At study end, subjects attended open clinic sessions in which blood pressure was assessed by registered nurses blinded to subjects' randomization allocation. Three blood pressure measurements were taken according to study protocol using an appropriately sized cuff and standard mercury sphygmomanometer after the subject had been sitting quietly for at least 5 min with no less than 5 min between measurements. The mean of the second and third pressures was used for analysis. If a subject failed to attend the exit visit despite multiple contact attempts (i.e., drop out), a chart review was conducted to extract the last available clinic blood pressure for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.\nSelf-management. Patient self-management knowledge and behavior measures were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire completed at baseline and exit study visit. An internally designed ten-item instrument was tested for readability, face and content validity with local experts, and for internal validity in a sample of patients. An aggregate score was calculated based on the number of correctly answered questions. Assessment of medication adherence consisted of four validated patient self-reported questions. Subjects were also asked whether they used a home blood pressure monitoring device and, if so, whether they recorded their readings.\nResource Utilization. Healthcare utilization information was collected by chart audit during the period of time from subject consent through the date of the exit visit. Information on the number and purpose for each office visit with a primary care provider and/or a pharmacist was extracted. This information was reported in three categories: (1) primary care provider, (2) pharmacist, and (3) the sum of total clinic visits. Information was also collected on antihypertensive use including drug class(es), generic status, dosages per day, and number of pills per day.\nQuality of Life and Satisfaction. Subjects' health status was evaluated at the exit visit using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 survey reporting scaled results for the eight domains, as well as physical and mental health composite scores. In addition, subjects were asked to rate their satisfaction with components of healthcare delivery and hypertension treatment. The general healthcare domain included six questions about satisfaction with provider, health plan, and care delivery (e.g., access, service). The hypertension-specific domain included five questions inquiring about satisfaction with explanations of hypertension, antihypertensive medications, cost of antihypertensive medications, time spent discussing hypertension, and satisfaction with hypertension monitoring.\nStatistical Analysis. A sample size of 151 subjects per arm was required to detect a 3-mmHg difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures between intervention and control groups for 90% power at a significance level of p<0.05 (twosided), assuming a standard deviation for systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 8 mmHg.\nThe primary outcomes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure between groups at the study end were compared using unpaired t-tests. Other continuous data were described by mean (standard deviation) and were compared using paired t-test for within-group baseline-to-final assessment comparisons and unpaired t-tests for between-group analysis. Association between continuous variables was measured using correlation analysis. Categorical data were described by percentages and were compared by chi-square tests with continuity correction or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to evaluate continuous variables such as quality-of-life composite scores, hypertension knowledge, and patient satisfaction. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for between-group comparisons for variables that were not normally distributed. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test for paired samples was used for within-group comparisons. The significance level was set at 0.05. All analyses were completed using SAS version 9.1.", "heading": "Outcome Measures"}, {"text": "A total of 2,901 candidates were identified as eligible and mailed an invitation to participate. Of the 463 subjects consenting to participate (16% response rate), 233 were allocated to usual care, and 230 were allocated to team-based care (Fig. ). The intervention and control arms were comparable with respect to age, gender, education, insurance, body mass index, smoking status, prevalence of chronic illness, and baseline blood pressure with the exception of history of stroke (Table ). As seen in Fig. , a total of 191 subjects (41%) withdrew from the study following randomization, 88 (38.3%) from the intervention arm and 103 (44.2%) from the control arm. Of subjects unavailable at the exit visit, all had documented blood pressures in the chart, with the exception of seven subjects (n=4 control; n=3 intervention), in which case the last clinic blood pressures were carried forward. Detailed analyses published elsewhere demonstrate that the groups remained comparable despite withdrawal. Clinical. Between-group analysis revealed significant differences in mean systolic (\u0394=6 mmHg, p=0.007) and diastolic (\u0394= 3 mmHg, p=0.003) blood pressures between groups at study end with subjects receiving team-based care achieving lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures as compared to control (Table ). In addition, 62% (88/142) of intervention subjects had a blood pressure <140/90 mmHg at the exit visit as compared to 44% (57/130) of control subjects (p=0.003). The odds of achieving blood pressure target in the intervention group were 2.08 times higher than the control group (95% CI=1. 29-3.38). These differences remained significant when data were assessed by intention-to-treat analysis.\nSelf-management. At study end, there was no difference in hypertension-related knowledge scores between study arms with a mean score of 7.5 (SD=1.86) in the control arm and 7.9 (SD=1.65) in the intervention arm (p=0.27). There was a statistically significant interaction between time and group (p = 0.0013) such that hypertension-related knowledge increased in the intervention arm and decreased in the control arm from study start to end. Analysis was completed to evaluate the relationship between hypertension knowledge and achievement of blood pressure target. Only in the intervention arm, there was a significant difference in hypertension knowledge between those subjects who achieved the target blood pressure (mean score=8.2) and those who did not meet target (mean score=7. 4", "heading": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "There was no difference between groups at study end in the proportion of subjects reporting high medication adherence [67% (95/142) intervention vs. 69% (90/130) control, p=0.77].

Although subjects receiving the intervention demonstrated an increase in the high adherence category from baseline (61% vs. 67%), the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). High medication adherence failed to predict hypertension goal attainment in either group. At study end, subjects in the intervention arm reported owning a home blood pressure monitoring device more frequently than control subjects [70% (70/99) vs. 51% (46/91), p=0.007]. A higher proportion of subjects in the intervention arm also reported recording their home blood pressures in a logbook as compared to control [80% (56/70) vs. 53% (24/46), p=0.002].\nResource Utilization. The total number of clinic visits (physician + pharmacist) was significantly higher in the intervention arm as compared to control (Table ). However, the number of physician visits was significantly lower in the intervention arm (3.2 vs. 4.7, p<0.0001). The pharmacy visits (n=26) in the control arm represented by six subjects were cases where the physician requested and received a pharmacy consultation for hypertension. The number of office visits was not statistically associated with systolic blood pressure in either study arm (intervention: r=0.16, p=0.06 and control: r=-0.1, p=0.22), but was negatively associated with diastolic blood pressure in both study arms (intervention: r=-0.22, p=0.01 and control: r=-0.18, p=0.04).\nThe number of antihypertensive medications increased significantly in both groups as compared to baseline. Although subjects in the intervention arm were prescribed a higher number of antihypertensive medications, there was a small but insignificant decrease in the daily pill burden of this group (Table ). This decrease is explained by a higher penetration of combined dosage forms in the intervention arm. The intervention group was also significantly more likely to utilize generic antihypertensive medications.", "heading": ", p=0.03)."}, {"text": "There were no significant differences between groups with respect to subjects' quality of life at follow-up with the exception of the general health domain (p=0.01), in which scores were slightly higher in the control group compared to intervention (Table ).

There was no significant difference between groups in any of the 11 satisfaction measures and no association between satisfaction and blood pressure goal attainment (p=0.4).", "heading": "Quality of Life and Satisfaction."}, {"text": "In this study, subjects cared for in the physician-pharmacist team model were 40% more likely to achieve their goal blood pressure compared to those cared for by their physician alone. Among middle-aged patients (i.e., 60-69 years), the 6-mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure observed in this study would be expected to yield a 22% reduction in stroke mortality and a 17% reduction in mortality from ischemic heart disease. Thus, inclusion of pharmacy practitioners on the primary care team represents one possible strategy to address this important public health issue.\nAlternatively, elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which the team-based model achieved superior outcomes in this study may facilitate modification of physician practice within the current healthcare delivery model. National guidelines recommend combination therapy as a means to intensify treatment without increased complexity, a practice implemented in higher frequency in the team-based arm. Patient costsharing is another factor in medication adherence. Although this study did not assess patient medication cost-share, the higher generic prescribing rate in the collaborative arm can be considered a surrogate outcome for cost.\nGiven the recent findings by Lee et al. , it was surprising that our study found no difference between arms in self-reported medication adherence. The four-item selfreported questionnaire may not have been sensitive enough to detect a difference if it did exist. Subjects in the team-based care intervention appeared more engaged in the management of their hypertension as indicated by increased home blood pressure monitoring. Another commonly proposed mechanism, not evaluated in this study, is time spent with the patient during each visit. Moreover, physicians in the study were undoubtedly confronted with multiple health issues, while in the team-based model pharmacists were able to focus more narrowly on management of hypertension.\nAlthough subjects in the intervention arm were prescribed a higher number of antihypertensive medications, our study found a negligible impact of the team-based care on patient quality of life and satisfaction. Other evidence suggests that the impact of similar pharmacy interventions on patient quality of life represents a neutral to positive effect. These results dispel the notion that introducing pharmacists into primary care-based chronic disease management risks jeopardizing the physician-patient relationship.\nThe fundamental requirements for successful generalization of this strategy include an adequate workforce of trained pharmacy practitioners and third party reimbursement. Given shortfalls in effectiveness of the current healthcare delivery model, projected physician shortages, and the preponderance of evidence demonstrating improved outcomes when pharmacists actively participate on patients' care team, the inclusion of pharmacists as healthcare providers eligible for reimbursement for cognitive services warrants serious consideration.\nThe results of this study add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the positive effect of physician-pharmacist team-based management of hypertension. This study has several strengths, including (1) prospective, randomized, controlled design with evaluator blinding, (2) large community-based patient population with mixed insurance, (3) multi-site intervention including all physicians practicing in nine clinics, (4) involvement of multiple pharmacy practitioners, (5) 12-month study duration, and (6) inclusion of clinical, patient self-management, economic, quality of life, and satisfaction outcome measures.\nThis study is further unique compared to other published randomized controlled trials evaluating pharmacists' role in hypertension management. In contrast to most published studies, with the exception of a study conducted in a VA setting, the pharmacists in this study were empowered to alter the antihypertensive regimen, according to guidelines, without consulting the physician in advance. Unlike the VA study, where pharmacists were located in a separate pharmacist-run hypertension clinic, our study evaluated pharmacists co-located in the primary care clinic. In this more teamoriented setting, pharmacists were able to quickly consult the physician for cases involving complex co-morbidities or the need for departure from routine guidelines, possibly improving efficiency, communication, and trust.\nIn this study, randomization at the patient level, as opposed to physician or clinic, may have resulted in contamination bias. Physicians in the study cared for patients in both groups and, further, co-signed the chart note following every pharmacist-patient interaction. In addition, at the request of the physician, six subjects in the control group received pharmacy consultation during the study. Although contamination was considered during study design, investigators recognized that it would conservatively represent bias toward the null hypothesis. Further, subjects in the usual care arm were offered active interventions. These interventions included (1) mailed patient educational information, (2) patient prompts where there was not a scheduled appointment, and (3) physician prompts for patients with elevated blood pressure. These interventions may also have blunted the difference in outcomes between arms.\nIn this study, we observed that only 16% of patients with an active medical record who were solicited to participate via a mailed invitation responded and subsequently consented. In practice, unlike the screening and enrollment methods employed in the study, patients are typically seen by a clinical pharmacy practitioner following a direct verbal referral by the PCP. This more traditional referral process might be expected to yield a higher screening-to-enrollment ratio relative to the low-touch methodology used here. Effective referral and enrollment methodologies, as well as patient acceptance of team-based care involving a pharmacy practitioner, merit further investigation.\nThe subject withdrawal rate observed in this study is similar to the rate reported in other hypertension management studies. This study used a low intensity screening and consent process, which might contribute to the high withdrawal rate. Analyses published elsewhere demonstrate that the high withdrawal rate observed in this study did not likely create an important imbalance in between-group subject characteristics for those who completed the study. When subjects who completed and withdrew from the study were compared, the only factor significantly associated with a higher withdrawal rate was enrollment in commercial insurance. The external validity of this study was also not affected by subject dropout and may even have been enhanced due to the naturalistic subject recruitment strategy. Regardless of the type of analysis conducted (analysis of subjects completing the study or last value carried forward for all enrolled subjects), a similar reduction in blood pressure was observed in the intervention group.", "heading": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Involvement of pharmacy practitioners in management of hypertension significantly improves blood pressure control.

Prior studies have demonstrated substantial problems in the quality of hypertension treatment and low rates of blood pressure control, as well as racial and socioeconomic disparities. Hypertension is particularly burdensome among racial/ethnic minority groups and hypertension-related cardiovascular disease has been shown to be the greatest contributor to racial differences in mortality. Several reviews have emphasized the importance of designing pragmatic interventions to improve care and reduce disparities in outcomes of chronic diseases ; one such intervention may be the use of computerized decision support (CDS). In a prior randomized trial, we found that CDS for diabetes and coronary artery disease care were effective for improving provider adherence with recommended processes of care. Other studies have also demonstrated that computer-based reminders are effective in improving measures of process of care, but intermediate clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure control, are rarely examined and when studied are frequently not improved. We utilized a practical cluster randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of CDS, designed to remind physicians about hypertension treatment guidelines with the goals of: (1) improving levels of blood pressure control, (2) improving provider adherence with recommended drug therapy, and (3) reducing racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.", "heading": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The trial period was from July 1, 2003 through February 1, 2005.

In addition, we examined electronic prescribing records for each patient, collecting data on new antihypertensive medication prescribing within 7 days of each reminder date. We selected a period of 7 days to identify medication changes that were more likely the direct result of the reminder being seen by the provider.

We defined the last hypertension-related visit during the study period as the outcome visit to reflect the HEDIS measure of most recent blood pressure control and to allow the most time between physician exposure to CDS and clinical outcomes. Abstracters obtained blood pressure readings from 2 sources: (1) the vital signs field of the electronic medical record, which contains blood pressure measures typically entered by a nurse or medical assistant when the patient registers for an appointment, and ( ) the text of the provider's encounter note for each visit. We examined the text of providers' notes for blood pressure readings because nurses/medical assistants did not uniformly transfer readings into the electronic vital signs field in all clinics until January of 2005 when all the affiliated clinics had electronic blood pressure devices that allowed them to directly download readings into the electronic record.\nIf more than 1 blood pressure was documented for a visit, we averaged them to obtain the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We also classified each mean blood pressure as controlled (<130/80 for patients with diabetes or renal failure or <140/90 for other patients) or uncontrolled. Visits with undocumented blood pressures were also classified as uncontrolled. We found blood pressure was documented for 97% of index and 95% of outcome visits.

For this reason, all analyses were carried out using the SUDAAN software package to account for correlation between patients seen by the same physician and between physicians practicing within the same clinic. We tested the effectiveness of the CDS using \"intent-to-treat\" analyses; all patients' whose initial visits occurred in an intervention clinic were assigned to that intervention throughout the analyses. Study endpoints included blood pressure control and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the outcome visit. In addition, for each encounter where a reminder was generated or suppressed we examined whether the provider prescribed a medication in the recommended drug class within 1 week of the visit date. We compared patients' baseline demographic and clinical characteristics by study arm (Table ) using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. We report two-tailed P values with statistical significance set at P\u22640.05 for these analyses.\nWe analyzed a series of multivariable logistic regression models to assess whether CDS was associated with the prescribing of a guideline recommended drug class or outcome visit blood pressure control compared to usual care. Using linear regression, we assessed whether the intervention was associated with improved outcome visit mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. All models adjusted for patients' sociodemographic characteristics. To adjust for severity of illness, models included an adjustment for the number of patient care visits each patient received the year before the intervention. In addition, because the NP pilot was also aimed at improving blood pressure control, models predicting outcome blood pressure levels also contained an adjustment for NP and patients' baseline blood pressure.

Interventions conducted in these practice locations are particularly relevant because they provide chronic disease care for a disproportionately larger number of minority patients. We found that CDS to physicians about hypertension treatment guidelines increased recommended medication prescribing compared to usual care. No significant improvements, however, were observed in measures of blood pressure control. In addition, we found that the effectiveness of our intervention did not differ by patients' race/ethnicity and mild disparities in blood pressure control persisted.\nThere are many potential explanations as to why our CDS had no impact with respect to blood pressure control. Our intervention was designed to remind physicians of the appropriate JNC drug class to prescribe for special hypertensive patients (i.e., beta blockade for patients with coronary disease) and was not designed to remind providers about appropriate intensification of antihypertensive therapy. In a study published in 2004, we examined patients receiving care in these settings and found that blood pressure remained poorly controlled among only 36% of hypertension-related visits, although patients were receiving a JNC-recommended medi-cation for 81% of visits. We also found that minorities were more likely to have poorly controlled hypertension despite being more likely to receive a guideline-recommended drug. Secondary analyses of these data determined that Hispanics, the racial/ethnic group with poorest control, were less likely to have had their therapy appropriately intensified at any time over a 1-year period and that intensification of therapy was highly correlated with obtaining subsequent blood pressure control. Future interventions aimed at increasing rates of appropriate antihypertensive intensification should be studied to determine whether such CDS can improve hypertension outcomes and future studies aimed at reducing disparities may require more intensive, nonclinic-based interventions to overcome factors that pose particular challenges for traditionally underserved patients, such as lack of access to medications, medical mistrust, and environmental stress. Focusing solely on blood pressure control as an outcome may detract attention from other evidence-based quality measures that can be more readily improved. For example, increasing appropriate ACE-inhibitor prescribing for hypertension patients with diabetes or congestive heart failure may be especially important, yet the associated outcomes related to increasing ACE-inhibitor use are longer term and would require a longer study period and larger sample size to document a meaningful effect. Focusing solely on measures, like blood pressure control, that can be defined and measured in the short term might understate the true impact of the guideline adherence. Our study has additional limitations. First, we relied on medical charts to measure quality of care and blood pressure control, which may have led to an underestimation of actual level of care provided. Second, whereas we assessed important markers of quality, some clinics might have improved in areas of care that we did not measure (e.g., improving provider experiences). Last, we did not survey providers about their opinions and knowledge of the clinical guidelines used as a basis for our CDS. Prior research has demonstrated that provider disagreement with guideline recommendations might be a significant barrier to provider guideline adherence. We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial of a CDS system within academic and community-based practices providing hypertension care to a multiethnic sample of patients. Whereas we found that CDS significantly improved appropriate medication prescribing, we observed no reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in care or improvement in blood pressure control. The substantial room for improvement in blood pressure control in the postintervention period suggests the need for future work focusing on different targets for CDS and the study of other practical interventions to reduce disparities in blood pressure control.", "heading": "DISCUSSION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

The study was carried out from July 2009 to June 2010 in a hypertension/dyslipidemia clinic in the university hospital of Cova da Beira Hospital Centre, Covilha \u02dc, located in the Eastern Central Region of Portugal. The study was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee for the use of humans in research, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their enrollment in the study.\nOutpatients attending the medical clinic for routine follow-up were randomly allocated either to a control group [(CG) usual care, where no pharmaceutical care is provided] or to an intervention group [(IG) pharmaceutical care, consisting of quarterly follow-up by a hospital clinical pharmacist during a 9-month period]. Participants were allocated following simple randomisation procedures (equal allocation and without restrictions) using a computer-generated list of random numbers. The allocation sequence was concealed from the clinical pharmacist enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The computer generated the allocation sequence and the envelopes were prepared by a researcher with no clinical involvement in the trial. Based on the nature of the intervention, it is not feasible to blind hypertensive patients in pharmaceutical intervention models. Thus, whereas patients, pharmacists and physicians were aware of the patient allocated arm, nurses assessing BP were kept blinded to the allocation.\nThe pharmaceutical care provided to the IG by a clinical pharmacist consisted in the baseline visit (lasting approximately 30 min) and the follow-up visits (lasting approximately 20 min) conducted with each intervention patient at 3 and 6 months. The clinical pharmacist could also schedule additional optional visits between scheduled visits at his discretion. At each visit, the clinical pharmacist conducted a thorough interview of the patient, identified problems leading to poor BP control, provided patient education (hypertension education, BP self-monitoring recommendation, goal BP to achieve, lifestyle education and counselling, medication education and counselling tips to enhance adherence), and presented recommendations to the physician regarding changes in drug therapy. The recommended lifestyle changes for BP control were in accordance with the JNC 7 guidelines . Patients in the IG were also provided with written educational material about hypertension and possible complications, as well as healthy lifestyle practices. Furthermore intervention patients were encouraged to bring all empty blisters and boxes of antihypertensive medication to clinic visits for recycling and to verify compliance to therapy. The CG had no clinical pharmacist involvement and control patients received the traditional service provided by the hospital clinic.\nThe primary outcome measures with respect to pharmaceutical care efficacy were the proportion of patients achieving BP control and reduction in baseline SBP and DBP. The BP clinic measurement was performed by trained nurses blind to the study, according to the published guidelines on proper BP measurement issued by the Portuguese Society of Hipertension . Validated automatic BP measuring devices (Omron M4-I, validated by the British Society of hypertension ) and appropriate cuffs were used, the mean of two consecutive measurements being recorded. The secondary outcome measure was antihypertensive medication adherence, which was determined in both arms by a pharmacist using a validated five-item adherence scale , derived from the four-item scale developed by Morisky et al. . Low medication adherence was defined as answering yes to 3 or more of 5 questions . Patient knowledge of target BP values and of hypertension risks were also evaluated. Patients were considered knowledgeable of target BP values if they knew both target BP figures (\\140/\\90 mmHg for hypertensive patients without diabetes and CKD and \\130/\\80 mmHg for hypertensive patients with diabetes or CKD). They were considered knowledgeable of the negative impacts of hypertension to health if they mentioned at least two potential major negative consequences of uncontrolled hypertension to health. SBP and DBP levels, BP control, medication adherence, patient knowledge of target BP values and of hypertension risks of both groups were assessed and compared at baseline and at the end of a 9-month period. In the final study visit (9-month) the IG did not receive pharmaceutical care and both arms had BP measured by a research nurse, and had medication adherence assessed by a pharmacist.

The clinical pharmacist scheduled a mean \u00b1 SD of 0.6 \u00b1 0.6 additional visits per patient in the IG, involving a total of 51 patients (7 patients had 2 additional visits).\nAt the beginning of the study, only 30 of 98 (30.6%) patients in the IG had both SBP and DBP controlled. This was not significantly different from the number in the CG, where 35 of 99 (35.4%) patients had their BP controlled (P = 0.480). At the end of the study, BP was controlled among significantly more patients in the IG (66.0%) than in the CG (41.7%) (P = 0.0008), with an odds ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5-4.9) (Table ).\nThe SBP was reduced by 0.8 mmHg in the CG and 7.6 mmHg in the IG (P = 0.005 for between-group SBP comparison). The DBP was reduced by 1.1 mmHg in the CG and 3.0 mmHg in the IG (P = 0.016 for betweengroup DBP comparison) (Table ).\nA sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our findings in the presence of informative dropout was performed. The analysis was repeated under the most pessimistic scenario in which all 4 dropouts in the IG had uncontrolled BP and all 3 dropouts in the CG had controlled BP. In this situation, the respective BP control rates would be 63.3 and 43.4% (odds ratio of 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-4.0; P = 0.005). Similarly, if we consider the last available clinic BP extracted in all 7 dropouts, SBP was reduced by 0.9 mmHg in the CG and 7.4 mmHg in the IG (P = 0.006 for between-group SBP comparison). The DBP was reduced by 1.0 mmHg in the CG and 2.7 mmHg in the IG (P = 0.020 for between-group DBP comparison) (Table ).\nThe intervention pharmacist made 118 recommendations about antihypertensive therapy, of which 90 (76.3%) were accepted by physicians. These recommendations included maintaining current antihypertensive medication (54.2%), introduction of additional medication (25.4%), dosage increase of existing medication (13.5%), cessation of current medication (5.9%) and dosage decrease of existing medication (0.8%). Despite these recommendations, the mean of overall changes in antihypertensive medication did not differ in IG and CG (0.65 vs. 0.72 changes per subject in the IG and CG, respectively, P = 0.693), neither did the number of new antihypertensive medications (0.34 vs. 0.37, P = 0.768) or the number of discontinued antihypertensive medications (0.20 vs. 0.19, P = 0.879). Likewise, the mean \u00b1 SD number of antihypertensive medications was not different between the IG (2.8 \u00b1 1.3 medications) and the CG (2.7 \u00b1 1.4 medications) at the end of the study (P = 0.682). Similarly, the antihypertensive medications prescribed did not BP blood pressure, DBP diastolic blood pressure, SBP systolic blood pressure significantly differ in both groups at the end of the study (Table ). Body mass index (BMI) did not significantly differ at the end of the study either (end BMI was 29.9 and 29.3 for IG and CG, respectively, P = 0.364) despite the pharmacist's recommendation of lifestyle changes.\nBaseline low medication adherence did not significantly differ in both groups (53.1% in the IG and 50.5% in the CG, P = 0.718). However, at the end of the study there was a significant difference (P = 0.0017) in the percentage of patients with low medication adherence between the IG (22.3%, within group P \\ 0.0001) and the CG (43.8%, within group P = 0.345).\nSimilarly, baseline patient knowledge of target BP values and of the potential complications of high BP to their health did not significantly differ in both groups (Table ). However, at the end of the study there was a significant difference in the percentage of patients reporting correctly both target BP figures and hypertension risks (Table ).\nBoth differences remained significant when data were assessed by ITT analysis (Table ).", "heading": "Results"}, {"text": "The pharmacist intervention program developed for this 9month study resulted in significant reduction of SBP and DBP and in an increase in the proportion of patients with controlled BP according to JNC-7 guidelines.

Previously reported reduction of SBP and DBP levels in patients receiving pharmaceutical care varied between 6.0 and 31.0 mmHg and 3.0 and 14.2 mmHg, respectively . In the present study, a 7.6/3.0 mmHg reduction was observed in the IG; this may be partly explained by the low mean SBP and DBP level of the study population at baseline (141.8/85.8 mmHg). Indeed, most of those studies only enrolled hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP, contrary to the current study in which all hypertensive patients taking antihypertensive medications for at least 6 months were included (whether their BP was controlled or not); this approach is closer to the actual context in which the pharmacist could work in our clinic. Nevertheless, the pharmacist intervention was effective in the management of BP and was consistent with the chronic care model in which the hypertension clinic uses teambased care.\nThe intervention program reported here resulted in significant improvement in antihypertensive medication adherence, which is a likely reason for better BP control in the IG because antihypertensive medications additions did not differ. It must be acknowledged that some studies reported statistically significant improvements in treatment outcomes (SBP, DBP and/or percentage of participants with controlled BP at the end of the study) without significant increases in medication adherence . This may be attributed to an intensification of antihypertensive medication and some pharmacist interventions led to a significant improvement in BP control by this mechanism, i.e., overcoming clinical inertia . However, most studies that reported a statistically significant increase in medication adherence also reported a statistically significant improvement in treatment outcomes, which reveals that medication adherence is a key factor (although not the only one) to achieve BP control . When baseline medication adherence is high ([75%), pharmacist interventions are not likely to find a statistically significant improvement in this outcome . In the current study, the low baseline medication adherence (\\50%) made it feasible for pharmaceutical intervention to have a positive effect in this outcome and hence in treatment outcomes. Increase in medication adherence obtained could be attributed to the hypertension and drug education given to patients. Lack of knowledge about BP targets, hypertension complications and the benefits of antihypertensive medication have been recognized as a barrier to adherence .\nSeveral limitations of this study must be mentioned. First, although RCTs provide the highest internal validity by controlling confounding bias, their use is limited by contaminating the CG by contact with the intervention program. In the present study, randomisation at the patient level, as opposed to pharmacist or physician, may have resulted in contamination bias. Several patients in the CG asked the pharmacist about their goal BP targets and about the possible serious consequences of high BP at the beginning of the study, and, further, physicians in the study cared for patients in both groups. Although contamination was considered during the study design, researchers recognized that it would conservatively represent bias toward the null hypothesis. Second, the evaluation of BP control was based on the measurements performed in two single clinic appointments (baseline and after a 9-month followup period). These BP measurements may or may not be representative of the adequacy of BP control in hypertensive patients, even though they were performed by blinded nurses, which contributes to the validity of observed effects. Third, medication adherence was measured by the research (not blinded) pharmacist, which is potentially biased in situations where the patient does not respond with determination to the questionnaire. Finally, the intervention was short, lasting only 9 months. Future research should be of a longer duration to determine if the effect of pharmacist management of hypertension is sustainable.", "heading": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Pharmacist intervention can modify factors affecting adherence, improve adherence and reduce BP levels in patients treated with antihypertensive agents.

To have an impact on public health, advances in the treatment of depression must be realized in primary care. Although recent studies have shown that a variety of primary care interventions can improve depression outcomes among older adults, these interventions are not being widely implemented in practice. Some evidence indicates that addressing medical comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD), may be essential in managing depression. In addition, managing depression in the context of medical comorbidity may be more acceptable to patients than managing depression alone. Despite these fi ndings, no known trials have been conducted in primary care integrating the Hillary R.

Hypertension affects between 20% to 50% of adults in most countries and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, representing two-thirds of all strokes and one-half of all ischemic heart disease. Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, and it is associated with poor adherence to antihypertensive medications. We chose an adherence-based approach because, although effi cacious pharmacotherapy for many chronic medical conditions exists, many patients are not adherent to treatment and are therefore at increased risk for a variety of complications. Poor adherence to treatment remains a serious impediment to improving care. Our conceptual framework, adapted from Cooper and colleagues, is practical in its approach and provided a framework that allowed for fl exible, tailored interventions (Figure ). Our intervention addressed each factor resulting in nonadherence in the conceptual model by means of a multifaceted, individualized approach in which participants worked with the integrated care manager to develop strategies to overcome barriers to adherence to medications.\nWe hypothesized that in a sample of older primary care patients with depression and hypertension, patients who were randomized to receive the intervention compared with usual care would have the following outcomes after a 4-week period: (1) fewer depressive symptoms, (2) lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, (3) a greater proportion with 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication, and (4) a greater proportion with 80% or greater adherence to an antihypertensive medication.\nThe research protocols were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave written informed consent.", "heading": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": null, "heading": "METHODS"}, {"text": "Patients were recruited from a community-based primary care practice in West Philadelphia with 12 family physicians.

To enroll as many older persons as possible who were willing and able to participate, we included participants with a range of depressive symptoms refl ecting the concept of the relapsing, remitting nature of depression in primary care. Nine patients were excluded: 4 were cognitively impaired, 2 were unable to communicate in English, 2 resided in a care facility that provides medications on a schedule, and 1 was unable to use Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps (AARDEX, Zug, Switzerland), which are microelectionic monitoring devices.

The goals of integrated care are to enhance quality of care and quality of life, consumer satisfaction, and system effi ciency for patients with complex problems, cutting across multiple sectors and clinicians. Relying on this framework, we carried out an integrated care intervention to promote patients' adherence to antihypertensive and antidepressant treatment. Our study differed from other studies by focusing on the integrated care manager's unique role as an intermediary or liaison between the physician and the elderly depressed patient with hypertension. The integrated care manager collaborated with physicians to help participating patients recognize depression in the context of hypertension, offered the patients guideline-based treatment recommendations, monitored the patients' treatment adherence and clinical status, and provided appropriate follow-up. The key components of this integrated care intervention were (1) providing the patient with an individualized program that is congruent with patients' social and cultural context; and (2) integrating depression treatment with hypertension management.\nThe integrated care manager worked individually with patients to address the factors involved in adherence as displayed in our conceptual model (Figure ). Through in-person sessions and telephone conversa-tions, the integrated care manager provided education about depression and hypertension, emphasizing the importance of controlling depression to manage hypertension; offered encouragement and relief from stigma; helped to identify target symptoms for both conditions; explained the rationale for antidepressant and antihypertensive medication usage; assessed for side-effects and assisted in their management; assessed progress (eg, reduction in depressive symptoms); assisted with referrals; and monitored and responded to life-threatening symptoms (eg, chest pain, suicidality). The intervention was offered to patients as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, existing primary care treatment. We chose this multifaceted approach because education alone has not been found to be effective for improving adherence. The intervention consisted of 3, 30-minute in-person sessions and 2, 15-minute telephone-monitoring contacts during a 4-week period. A master's level research coordinator was trained as an integrated care manager and administered all study activities. Before the trial started, the integrated care manager received training on pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension management during weekly clinical sessions with the principal investigator. While under the supervision of the principal investigator, the integrated care manager conducted mock study activities with 2 participants and thereafter received ongoing weekly supervision for all study activities, with the principal investigator monitoring 25% of weekly sessions to ensure the integrated care manager adhered to study protocols.", "heading": "Intervention"}, {"text": "At baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, usual care participants underwent the same assessments as participants in the integrated care intervention.

We asked patients whether they resided in a care facility that provided their medications on a schedule and whether they were unwilling or unable to use the MEMS caps.\nAt baseline sociodemographic characteristics were assessed using standard questions. We measured patients' functional status using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36). Depression, blood pressure, and adherence were measured at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depression. This scale was developed by the National Institute of Mental Health and has been used widely in research among the elderly. Patients' blood pressure was assessed in accordance with American Heart Association Guidelines 30 using the BpTRU (BpTRU Medical Devices, Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada), an automated device that is designed for clinical settings and avoids observer bias.

Because the proportion of pills taken was highly skewed and failed normality assumptions, adherence was dichotomized at a threshold of 80%, a level used to assess adherence to medication regimens.

Primary care patients randomized to an integrated care intervention, when compared with participants randomized to usual care, showed higher rates of adherence to antihypertensive and antidepressant medications, greater blood pressure control, and fewer depressive symptoms at the fi nal study visit (6 weeks). This study has several limitations. The fi rst is that we used MEMS caps to measure adherence. All methods for assessing adherence have limitations: selfreports may be insensitive, drug levels may be infl uenced by factors other than treatment adherence, pill counts are subject erratic patient behaviors, verifi cation of pharmacy records may be useful only for extended time frames, and MEMS caps may be expensive and opening pill bottles is assumed to be synonymous with medication ingestion. We chose to use MEMS caps as our primary measure of adherence because MEMS caps have a low failure rate and may be more sensitive than other adherence measures. In addition, prior studies have shown that MEMS caps do not signifi cantly infl uence adherence. Also, any effect of MEMS caps on medication adherence would be experienced equally in both groups and, therefore, would not infl uence a comparative assessment by randomization assignment.\nSecond, we have defi ned an adherence threshold of 80% in our analysis. Although this threshold has been assessed in some clinical research, the clinical relevance of this threshold has not been tested for many medications. Third, our results were obtained from patients who received care at one primary care site that might not be representative of most primary care practices. This practice was probably similar to other primary care practices in the region, however. Fourth, our preliminary investigation was limited to 64 participants, but participants were randomized to the intervention or usual care. Fifth, participants in the intervention group may have been subject to the Hawthorne effect, in which patients are more likely to adhere to their medical regimens than they would if they were not participating in the study. We suspect the Hawthorne effect would be minimal in this intervention, however, as participants in the usual care group had the same number of in-person contacts as participants in the integrated care intervention. Lastly, our intervention would require additional resources in primary care settings. Even so, we have designed a simple intervention, and future implementation will explore whether ancillary health personnel could be trained to carry out the intervention.\nDespite the limitations of this study, our results deserve attention because previous intervention trials in primary care have addressed depression and hypertension separately. Integrated interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where there are competing demands for limited resources. In our intervention, we integrated depression treatment into care for hypertension so a single program could assist patients with depression and hypertension. Consistent with our hypothesis, patients randomized to the integrated intervention had fewer depressive symptoms, lower systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and a greater proportion of participants with 80% or greater adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications at 6 weeks.

These fi ndings are aligned with recent fi ndings that older primary care patients are more likely to be engaged in integrated care than other forms of care provision, and integrated care models are particularly effective in improving access to and participation in mental health services among African American primary care patients. Many large-scale, randomized controlled trials using complex, multimodel, care management interventions have been successful in improving depression outcomes, but they have not integrated depression treatment with chronic medical conditions. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively brief, pilot, randomized controlled trial with a focus on adherence for the management of depression, as well as hypertension, in primary care. Further research is needed to evaluate this intervention in a larger, more representative sample with longer periods of follow-up. Future investigations could explore the training of ancillary health personnel who are already working in primary care practices to carry out the intervention.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it online at .

Limited evidence exists regarding individual characteristics associated with restaurant food environment policy acceptability, especially health-related characteristics. This study examined associations between health characteristics and restaurant food environment policy acceptability among urban Canadians.\n\nDESIGN:: Links between health characteristics and complete agreement levels with selected policies were examined using data in the cross-sectional Targeting Healthy Eating and Physical Activity survey study, that is, a large pan-Canadian study on policy acceptability.

Across all policies and analyses, those reporting excellent or very good health statuses were more likely to be in complete agreement with targeted policies than those with good health statuses. For selected policies and analyses, those reporting poor health statuses were also more likely to be in complete agreement than those describing their health status as good. For all policies and analyses, both those consuming restaurant-prepared foods daily and those never consuming these foods were more likely to be in complete agreement than those consuming these foods once per week.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:: More research is needed to explain discrepancies in acceptability according to health characteristics. Bringing this study\u2019s findings to the attention of policymakers may help build momentum for policy enactment.", "sections": {"chapters": [{"body": "Study design, sampling and weightingThis study used the cross-sectional data available from the Targeting Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (THEPA) survey. The THEPA survey provided novel information on urban Canadians\u2019 acceptability levels for forty-five built environment and policy interventions. These interventions concerned modifying the Covid-19 sanitary environment (n 7), the active living environment (n 26) and the food environment (n 12). This survey was completed by 27 162 Canadians living in the country\u2019s seventeen most densely populated CMAs. Data were collected between October and December 2020. Sample size objectives were established at 1200 participants for most CMAs. The THEPA survey dataset is nationally representative of the urban Canadian population, as data were weighted as a function of sex, age and education, based on data from the 2016 Canadian census( 26 ). Post-stratification weights were also applied at the CMA level to account for CMA size differences. Eligibility criteria and recruitmentAs the survey was available in either English or French, eligibility criteria included speaking/reading English and/or French. Participants had to be at least 18 years of age and minimally provide residential forward sortation area information. To complete the survey, participants were contacted either by email (based on previous enrolment in survey firm panels) or by phone (based on random digit dialling). MeasurementsAcceptabilityAcceptability was measured by asking participants to rate their level of agreement with the implementation of each intervention within their area of residence, that is, the area within a 15-min walking distance from one\u2019s dwelling. The three policies directly pertaining to the RFE were stated in the THEPA survey as follows:Change the usual side dish in restaurants for a healthier option like salad instead of fries. Impose municipal regulations to limit fast-food outlets around schools. Eliminate the offer of chips, candy and other unhealthy foods in restaurants, cafeterias and vending machines in municipal buildings like arenas and recreation centres. For each policy, a 4-point rating scale was provided. Response options were \u2018completely disagree\u2019, \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019, \u2018somewhat agree\u2019 and \u2018completely agree\u2019. Participants were also given the possibility to select the \u2018I don\u2019t know/ I prefer not to respond\u2019 case. Acceptability responses were then dichotomised into \u2018complete agreement\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019. The \u2018complete agreement\u2019 category encompassed \u2018completely agree\u2019 responses, whereas the \u2018other\u2019 category was comprised of \u2018somewhat agree\u2019, \u2018completely disagree\u2019 and \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 responses. Dichotomising the outcome variable as such was underpinned by Kingdon\u2019s theory highlighting the importance of high acceptability levels, compared with lower acceptability levels, to precipitate RFE policy change. As for the \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to respond\u2019 cases, these were considered missing. Sociodemographic characteristicsSociodemographic characteristics pertained to gender (\u2018man\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019), age (\u201818\u201334 years old\u2019, \u201835\u201354 years old\u2019 or \u201855 years old and over\u2019), highest educational attainment (\u2018high school and less\u2019, \u2018trade school or junior college\u2019 or \u2018university\u2019), gross household annual income (\u2018less than $40 000\u2019, \u2018$40 000\u2013$79 999\u2019, \u2018$80 000\u2013$119 999\u2019 or \u2018$120 000 and more\u2019), immigrant status (\u2018born in Canada\u2019, \u2018born in a high-income country (HIC) other than Canada\u2019 or \u2018born in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC)\u2019) and Indigenous status (\u2018Indigenous\u2019 or \u2018non-Indigenous\u2019). For an in-depth examination of how sociodemographic questions were formulated in the THEPA survey and for a better understanding of how the responses to the latter questions were recoded, see Lambert-De Francesch et al. (2024)( 17 ). Health characteristicsFour health-related variables from the THEPA survey were deemed relevant for this study: self-reported weight, self-reported height, frequency of consuming restaurant-prepared foods and perceived health status. To estimate weight, participants were asked \u2018How much do you weigh?\u2019. Participants could respond either in pounds or kilograms. To assess height, participants were asked \u2018How tall are you?\u2019. Participants could respond in either feet/inches or in metres. For both weight and height questions, an \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to answer\u2019 option was available. Using the provided anthropometric data, BMI scores were computed and recoded in the following weight status cutoffs: \u2018underweight\u2019 (< 18\u00b750 kg/m2), \u2018normal weight\u2019 (18\u00b750\u201324\u00b799 kg/m2), \u2018overweight\u2019 (25\u00b700\u201329\u00b799 kg/m2) and \u2018obese\u2019 (\u2265 30\u00b700 kg/m2)( 27 ). As a marker of dietary practices, participants were asked \u2018During an average week, how often do you eat in restaurants?\u2019, with response options being \u2018every day\u2019, \u2018a few times a week\u2019, \u2018once a week\u2019, \u2018less than once a week\u2019, \u2018never\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to answer\u2019. To assess health status, participants were asked \u2018Compared to other people of your age, would you say your health is \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018very good\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018fair\u2019, \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to answer\u2019. For both restaurant food consumption frequency and perceived health status variables, no response options were recoded, as this enabled a more fine-grained analysis of distinct categories. For all health characteristic variables, \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to answer\u2019 responses were considered missing. Data cleaning and imputingTo obtain BMI scores that would better mirror those extracted from measured data, modifications were made to the self-reported anthropometric data. The first step consisted of exclusively retaining height and weight values that were deemed biologically plausible. Height values that were considered biologically plausible ranged from 1\u00b712 m (3\u2032 8\u2033) to 2\u00b729 m (7\u2032 6\u2033), whereas weight values that were considered biologically plausible ranged from 34\u00b709 kg (75 lbs) to 454\u00b750 kg (1000 lbs). All values outside of these ranges were considered missing. The second data quality check consisted of creating z-scores for both height and weight to remove any potential outliers. Cases with standardised z-scores greater than 3\u00b729 were considered potential outliers and were thus considered missing( 28 ). The remaining values were used to compute BMI scores. These BMI scores underwent a third quality examination procedure. BMI values less than 12\u00b700 were considered biologically implausible. The fourth and final step to ensure that BMI values best reflected measured height and weight entailed applying gender-specific correction equations to BMI scores to curb social desirability biases( 29 ). Corrected BMI scores were then recoded into the above-mentioned BMI categories, that is, \u2018underweight\u2019, \u2018normal weight\u2019, \u2018overweight\u2019 or \u2018obese\u2019. To address potential issues that may arise from using incomplete survey datasets, imputed datasets (n 10) were created using multiple imputation( 28 ). Predictive mean matching methods were employed to identify case \u2018donors\u2019 that had similar predicted values to those of the missing value( 30 ). For each imputed dataset, one value among the donor case pool (n 5 potential donors) was randomly assigned to the missing data case. The ten datasets were pooled into one large dataset and used for statistical analyses. Data analysesDescriptive analyses were conducted to highlight participants\u2019 sociodemographic and health profiles. Among the non-weighted/non-imputed, weighted/non-imputed and weighted/imputed datasets, descriptive analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were only conducted on the weighted/imputed dataset to avoid duplication. Sociodemographic information based on non-weighted/non-imputed and weighted/non-imputed data has been reported and published elsewhere( 17 ). It was deemed important to present sociodemographic characteristics from the weighted/imputed dataset since these data slightly differ from what is presented in the aforementioned publication. As for the health variables of interest, given that these data have not been previously published, descriptive analyses were conducted on all three datasets. Up to this point, all steps were carried out using SPSS version 28. Logistic multilevel modelling analyses were then performed using HLM 8\u00b70 software. The latter statistical technique was deemed relevant for the current study objectives, as analysing the data via logistic multilevel modelling respects the data\u2019s nested structured (i.e. individuals nested within higher-level units, CMAs). Failure to recognise the hierarchical structure of the data may result in an underestimation of standard error values, incorrectly leading to narrower confidence intervals and greater risk of committing a type 1 error( 31 ). A total of three sets of analyses were performed using the weighted/imputed data. First, bivariate logistic multilevel regressions were performed to assess the distinct associations between individual-level variables (i.e. sociodemographic characteristics and health characteristics) and the acceptability levels of three RFE policies. Second, multivariate logistic multilevel regressions were conducted to investigate the associations between the three health characteristics, evaluated jointly, and the acceptability levels of each policy (model 1). Third, the latter examinations were replicated using the same type of analysis, this time adjusting for sociodemographic variables (model 2). Across all analyses, health and sociodemographic variables were modelled as level-1 fixed effects, meaning that their influence was assumed to be constant across CMAs. CMA of residence was considered a nesting factor (i.e. level-2 factor), reflecting the hierarchical nature of the dataset. Finally, odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confident intervals (CIs) are reported for all analyses.", "header": "METHODS"}, {"body": "Participant characteristicsTable 1 presents the sociodemographic and health characteristics of participants. According to the weighted/imputed dataset analyses, the sociodemographic characteristics with the highest prevalence included identifying as women (51\u00b78 %), being aged 55 years and older (35\u00b74 %), having a high school education level or lower (41\u00b72 %), having a gross household income of $40 000\u2013$79 999 per year (31\u00b78 %), being born in Canada (77\u00b78 %) and not self-identifying as Indigenous (94\u00b75 %). The most prevalent weight status was the overweight category, accounting for 33\u00b79 % of responses in the weighted/imputed dataset. The most frequent perceived health status was the \u2018good\u2019 category, representing 36\u00b72 % of responses in the weighted/imputed dataset. For the frequency of consuming restaurant-prepared foods variable, the less than once a week category was most observed (43\u00b72 % of responses).

Changing side dish defaultsFor the change the usual side dish policy, in terms of sociodemographic variables, across all analyses, greater odds of being in complete agreement with the selected policy were observed among women (OR: 1\u00b757, 95 % CI: 1\u00b749, 1\u00b767), those with household earnings that were less than $40 000 per annum (OR: 1\u00b715, 95 % CI: 1\u00b705, 1\u00b727), those born in a HIC other than Canada (OR: 1\u00b732, 95 % CI: 1\u00b716, 1\u00b750), those born in a LMIC (OR: 1\u00b726, 95 % CI: 1\u00b715, 1\u00b737) and those with an Indigenous status (OR: 1\u00b755, 95 % CI: 1\u00b736, 1\u00b776), in contrast to men, those with household earnings of $40 000\u2013$79 999 per annum, non-immigrants and non-Indigenous participants. A lower likelihood of being in complete agreement with the selected policy was observed among those aged 18\u201334 years old (in model 2 only, OR: 0\u00b787, 95 % CI: 0\u00b780, 0\u00b794) and those with household earnings of $80 000\u2013$119 999 per annum (in all analyses, OR: 0\u00b791, 95 % CI: 0\u00b784, 0\u00b799), compared with those aged 55 years and over and those with annual household incomes of $40 000\u2013$79 999. As for health characteristics, only in the bivariate analysis was one BMI category associated with complete agreement levels. Indeed, compared with those with a normal weight, those falling within the obese category had a lower likelihood of being in complete agreement with the policy (OR: 0\u00b790, 95 % CI: 0\u00b781, 0\u00b799). Furthermore, in contrast to those with a good perceived health status, across all analyses, both excellent (OR: 2\u00b712, 95 % CI: 1\u00b794, 2\u00b732) and very good (OR: 1\u00b732, 95 % CI: 1\u00b723, 1\u00b742) perceived health statuses were associated with a greater likelihood of expressing complete agreement for the selected policy. A poor health status was also associated with greater odds of being in complete agreement with the policy than a good health status, but this was unique to the bivariate association (OR: 1\u00b717, 95 % CI: 1\u00b701, 1\u00b736). In all analyses, greater odds of being in complete agreement with the targeted policy were also observed among those consuming restaurant-prepared foods every day and those never consuming restaurant-prepared foods, contrary to those eating restaurant-prepared foods once a week, with respective ORs being 1\u00b769 (95 % CI: 1\u00b733, 2\u00b716) and 1\u00b714 (95 % CI: 1\u00b704, 1\u00b725). Limiting fast foods around schoolsAnalogous to the first policy, independently of the type of analysis, women, those with household incomes of less than $40 000, those born in a HIC other than Canada, those with an Indigenous status, those with an excellent and very good perceived health status and those consuming restaurant-prepared food every day or never were all more likely to be in complete agreement with the targeted policy than men, those in the $40 000\u2013$79 999/year income category, those born in Canada, those with a non-Indigenous status, those with a good perceived health status and those consuming restaurant-prepared foods once per week. Respectively, ORs were 1\u00b719 (95 % CI: 1\u00b713, 1\u00b727) for women, 1\u00b713 (95 % CI: 1\u00b704, 1\u00b722) for those earning less than $40 000 per annum, 1\u00b714 (95 % CI: 1\u00b702, 1\u00b729) for those born in a HIC other than Canada, 1\u00b745 (95 % CI: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b765) for those with an Indigenous status, 1\u00b793 (95 % CI: 1\u00b776, 2\u00b711) for those with an excellent perceived health status, 1\u00b732 (95 % CI: 1\u00b723, 1\u00b742) for those with a very good perceived health status, 1\u00b792 (95 % CI: 1\u00b758, 2\u00b734) for those that eat restaurant-prepared foods every day and 1\u00b738 (95 % CI: 1\u00b726, 1\u00b752) for those that never eat restaurant-prepared foods. Once more, across analyses, those earning between $80 000 and $119 999 had lower odds of being in complete agreement with the targeted policy than those within the $40 000\u2013$79 999 income bracket (OR: 0\u00b790, 95 % CI: 0\u00b782, 0\u00b797). Akin to the first policy, there was no statistically significant association between BMI and acceptability levels, except for those in the obese category in the bivariate analysis, OR: 0\u00b791 (95 % CI: 0\u00b784, 0\u00b799). Despite the aforementioned similarities with the previous policy, selected differences are observed. Contrary to the first policy, those aged between 18 and 34 years old had lower odds of being in complete agreement with the targeted policy in all analyses than those aged 55 years and older (OR: 0\u00b785, 95 % CI: 0\u00b779, 0\u00b792). Also, unlike the first policy, across analyses, those with a high school level training (or less) and those with a trade/junior college training had a lower likelihood of completely agreeing with the selected policy than those with a university training, with ORs being 0\u00b780 (95 % CI: 0\u00b774, 0\u00b786) and 0\u00b789 (95 % CI: 0\u00b782, 0\u00b796), respectively. Furthermore, unique to this policy, being born in a LMIC was only associated with greater odds of being in complete agreement with the selected policy in the bivariate association (OR: 1\u00b709, 95 % CI: 1\u00b701, 1\u00b718), and this is comparative to those born in Canada. Finally, differing from the first policy, associations between poor perceived health status and complete agreement levels remained statistically significant, irrespective of the analysis, OR: 1\u00b720, 95 % CI: 1\u00b703, 1\u00b740. Eliminating unhealthy foodIn line with the two previous policies, women (OR: 1\u00b721, 95 % CI: 1\u00b713, 1\u00b729), those with household earnings of less than $40 000 per year (OR: 1\u00b719, 95 % CI: 1\u00b709, 1\u00b730), immigrants from a HIC other than Canada (OR: 1\u00b734, 95 % CI: 1\u00b715, 1\u00b757), those with an Indigenous status (OR: 1\u00b751, 95 % CI: 1\u00b733, 1\u00b772), those with an excellent health status (OR: 2\u00b715, 95 % CI: 1\u00b796, 2\u00b736), those with a very good health status (OR: 1\u00b737, 95 % CI: 1\u00b727, 1\u00b749), those consuming restaurant-prepared foods every day (OR: 2\u00b722, 95 % CI: 1\u00b779, 2\u00b775) and those never consuming restaurant-prepared foods (OR: 1\u00b730, 95 % CI: 1\u00b718, 1\u00b743) all had greater odds of expressing complete agreement with the targeted policy than those in the reference category. Unique to this policy, in all analyses, both those aged 18\u201334 years old and those aged 35\u201354 years old had lower odds of reporting complete agreement levels compared with those aged 55 years and over, with respective ORs being 0\u00b782 (95 % CI: 0\u00b775, 0\u00b790) and 0\u00b791 (95 % CI: 0\u00b784, 0\u00b799). Similarly to the second policy (i.e. limit fast-food outlets around schools), across analyses, having a high school level (or less) training was associated with lower odds of being in complete agreement with the policy (OR: 0\u00b778, 95 % CI: 0\u00b772, 0\u00b785). As for those with a trade school/junior college education, a significant association was only observed in bivariate associations, where participants with the latter level of education had lower odds of being in complete agreement with the targeted policy than those with a university degree (OR: 0\u00b792, 95 % CI: 0\u00b785, 0\u00b799). In all analyses, those from a LMIC displayed greater odds of being in complete agreement with the policy than their Canadian-born counterparts (OR: 1\u00b732, 95 % CI: 1\u00b720, 1\u00b745). Once more, BMI was mostly not associated with acceptability levels. Only findings from the bivariate analysis showed that those with BMIs falling in the obese category had lower odds of expressing complete agreement levels with the targeted policy than those with a normal weight (OR: 0\u00b788, 95 % CI: 0\u00b781, 0\u00b796). To better illustrate the pattern of findings for all three policies, histograms were created. Figures 1 , 2 and 3 portray predicted proportions of those in complete agreement with each RFE policy according to health characteristics. Predicted proportions were based on model 2 and were calculated for those whose sociodemographic characteristics matched the reference category. The predicted proportions were also calculated based on reference categories of the unexamined health variables. The 95 % CIs are not presented in the figures since estimates are based on predicted values derived from equations, contrary to estimates that are based on raw data. Figure 1.Predicted proportions, based on model 2, of participants being in complete agreement with each restaurant food environment policy according to BMI category.

Figure 2.Predicted proportions, based on model 2, of participants in complete agreement with each restaurant food environment policy according to perceived health status. Predicted proportions are illustrated for individuals corresponding to following reference categories (i.e. men, aged 55 years and over, with university training, with an annual household income of $40 000\u2013$79 999, that were born in Canada, that do not have an Indigenous status, that have a normal weight and that eat restaurant-prepared foods once per week). Figure 3.Predicted proportions, based on model 2, of participants in complete agreement with each restaurant food environment policy according to frequency of consuming restaurant-prepared foods. Predicted proportions are illustrated for individuals corresponding to the following reference categories (i.e. men, aged 55 years and over, with university training, with an annual household income of $40 000\u2013$79 999, that were born in Canada, that do not have an Indigenous status, that have a normal BMI and that have a good perceived health status). As shown in Fig. 1 , little variation in terms of predicted proportions exists across BMI categories, and this for the three policies. In Fig. 2 , across policies, those with an excellent and very good perceived health status discernibly had greater predicted proportions of being in complete agreement with the policies than those with a good health status. For the restrict choice policy, greater predicted proportions were also apparent for those with a poor health status, compared with the reference category. Finally, for Fig. 3 , those on opposite ends of the restaurant frequency consumption spectrum (i.e. those in the never and every day category) visually had greater predicted proportions of being in complete agreement than those consuming restaurant-prepared foods once a week.", "header": "RESULTS"}, {"body": "The purpose of this study was to examine associations between selected individual health characteristics and complete agreement levels of three distinct RFE policies among urban Canadian adults. Findings relating to the sociodemographic correlates of acceptability revealed that, based on the final model, women, those with household incomes inferior to $40 000 per annum, those who were born in a HIC other than Canada and those with an Indigenous status were more likely to be in complete agreement with all policies, compared with men, those with $40 000\u2013$79 999 household annual incomes, those born in Canada and those who are not Indigenous. As for those aged between 18 and 34 years old, these individuals were less likely to be in complete agreement with all policies, compared with those aged 55 years old and over. As for health-related findings, results indicated that BMI was generally not associated with acceptability of RFE policies. Across all three policies, those with either an excellent or a very good health status were more likely to express complete agreement with RFE policies than those with a good health status. For selected policies, those with a poor health status were also more likely to be in complete agreement with the examined policies than those with a good health status. For all three policies, those consuming restaurant-prepared foods every day and never had greater odds of being in complete agreement with RFE policies than those who reported consuming these foods once per week. As hypothesised elsewhere( 17 ), greater acceptability levels among women may be related to their greater health consciousness level( 32 ). As for greater acceptability levels among those with the lowest income category, this observation may be related to their financial limitations when it comes to purchasing nutritious foods( 33 , 34 ). Higher levels of acceptability among those born in a HIC other than Canada may be related to a higher level of familiarity with healthier RFE in their birth country( 17 ). As for results regarding Indigenous status, few acceptability studies have included this variable in their research, and further study is required to gain insight on these links( 22 ). Finally, lower acceptability levels observed among younger participants (18\u201334 years old) may be related to a lower level of awareness of the toll diet-related diseases may have as one ages( 15 ). In all cases, the above-described rationale behind associations is only speculative and requires further investigation( 17 ). When comparing results to studies that have examined associations between health characteristics and acceptability levels of RFE policies, our results regarding the lack of a statistically significant association between BMI (in multivariate analyses) and acceptability are similar to those of Bhawra et al. (2018)( 22 ). Similar to the current findings, these authors report no statistically significant association between BMI and support for selected RFE policies, such as fast-food zoning policies around schools among Canadians aged 16\u201330 years old. Results are also somewhat similar to those of Robles and Kuo (2017) who observed no statistically significant association between perceived weight status and acceptability for limiting/restricting food policies, such as limiting the count of fast foods within each community( 21 ). Yet, the commonalities between our findings and those of the latter authors may be limited by the fact that the latter authors created a five-item composite score for its limiting/restrictive policies, where only one item specifically related to our scope of interest (i.e. fast-food zoning policies). To the best of our knowledge, only one other study has examined the links between perceived health status and RFE policy acceptability( 21 ). These authors found no statistically significant association between their limiting/restrictive food policies and perceived health status, findings that are contrary to ours. More research is needed to reconcile these discrepant findings. Regarding restaurant frequency consumption variables, Robles and Kuo\u2019s (2017) study remains the only point of comparison( 21 ). These authors found no statistically significant association between frequency of consuming restaurant-prepared foods and acceptability of limiting/restricting food policies, like fast-food zoning restrictions. Although our results regarding restaurant food consumption frequency are not analogous to those of the latter study, selected results do converge with broader observations( 15 ). According to prior work linking personal impact of policies and acceptability levels of these policies( 15 , 18 , 19 ), those who never consume restaurant-prepared foods would be more likely to be in complete agreement with RFE policies than those consuming these foods once per week, a tendency that was confirmed by this study. Contrary to this general tendency are, however, our findings regarding those who consume these foods daily. Greater acceptability levels observed among the latter population segment may signal a desire for healthier restaurant food choices. More research is however needed on the matter. In terms of implications, the findings from this study may help advance knowledge regarding the agenda setting process required for RFE policy enactment. Identifying the individual health characteristics associated with RFE policy acceptability creates an opportunity for further discussion on the rationale behind these health-related differences in acceptability. Understanding the underlying drivers of acceptability levels according to health characteristics may help orient communication campaigns aimed at informing the public on the benefits of RFE policies and invalidating unfounded beliefs that may be hindering RFE policy acceptability levels across population subgroups. In line with the Multiple Streams Framework, a more favourable political climate, shaped by high acceptability levels, may ultimately help propel policy entrepreneurs\u2019 efforts in advocating for evidence-based RFE policies, thus contributing to overweight/obesity mitigation efforts. Methodological strong points pertain to the numerous steps taken to ensure the development of biologically plausible and likely valid BMI scores as well as the steps taken to conduct multiple imputations and logistic multilevel modelling analyses. Despite these strengths, there are certain caveats in this study\u2019s design. As mentioned previously, self-reporting of height and weight is subject to social desirability biases, which may lead to an overestimation of height and an underestimation of weight parameters( 29 ). Furthermore, BMI scores fail to account for body composition and body fat distribution( 35 ). Finally, an important limitation of this study is the fact that acceptability \u2018I don\u2019t know/I prefer not to respond\u2019 case options were recoded as missing. Further study could focus on the characteristics of participants who selected this response alternative. ConclusionThis study contributed to bridging current gaps in the food policy acceptability literature as key health characteristics associated with complete agreement levels for three RFE policies have been identified. The findings from this study lay the groundwork for further studies aiming to explore the underlying motives of health-related acceptability levels. Depicting a clearer portrait of RFE policy acceptability levels in urban Canada may help advance the RFE policy scene, necessary for addressing pressing public health nutrition issues.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

The objectives of the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 study are to investigate the relationship between nutrition and health outcomes and to examine the determinants of dietary patterns and nutritional status using a web-based approach. At baseline, participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires to assess dietary intake (via three 24-h dietary records randomly distributed over a 2-week period) and sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics. These characteristics were updated every 6\u201312 months during the follow-up. An ad hoc questionnaire on the acceptability and reasons for supporting or opposing food taxes was administered to NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 study participants aged 18 years and older from 8 March 2021 to 28 June 2021. The questionnaire for this study was the second part of a wider questionnaire, the first part of which asked participants about the acceptability of sugar taxation. After excluding participants from the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 study without data on food tax acceptability (n 443), the study sample consisted of 29 000 participants. This sample was weighted to improve its representativeness of the French adult population. Weights were calculated by sex using the CALMAR macro according to the 2016 national census (i.e. the most recent data available) of the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies reports on sex, age, education level, occupation, region of residence and marital status( 25 ). The study protocol was previously published and fully described in detail elsewhere( 26 ). MeasurementsFood taxes acceptabilityThe questionnaire focused on eight hypothetical taxes on foods with high levels of nutrients of concern and/or high environmental impact and/or high media coverage. A working group of experts in nutrition, public health and epidemiology developed the items. The questionnaire was then tested internally with other members of the research team (engineers, technicians, other researchers not involved in its development) and then tested on the first 1000 volunteers to correct errors and misunderstandings. In particular, they could ask questions or report problems spontaneously by email if they wished. They could also provide a feedback report at the end of the questionnaire. The acceptability of each food tax was measured by the following statement: \u2018If a new tax were to be introduced on certain foods, would you be in favour of including the following foods?\u2019 The food groups were fatty products (i.e. added fats such as butter and cream), sugary products (e.g. breakfast cereals, sweets), salty products (e.g. salted snacks, ready-made meals), fatty and sugary products (e.g. cookies, cakes, pastries), fatty and salty products (e.g. aperitifs, processed meat, cheeses), meat (including poultry), UPF and products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score front-of-pack labelling (i.e. scores D or E). Ultra-processed foods are those that have undergone intense industrial physical, chemical or biological processes (e.g. hydrogenation, moulding, extruding, preprocessing by frying) and/or that contain industrial substances not usually found in domestic kitchens (e.g. maltodextrin, hydrogenated oils or modified starches), cosmetic additives (e.g. dyes, emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners) or flavouring agents( 27 ). Nutri-Score is a summary front-of-pack nutrition label that uses five colours and letters (from green/A to dark orange/E) to help understand and compare the nutritional value of foods and has been voluntarily implemented in France since 2017( 28 ). Response options included \u2018strongly disagree\u2019, \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019, \u2018neither agree nor disagree\u2019, \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 and \u2018strongly agree\u2019. Participants who responded \u2018strongly agree\u2019 or \u2018somewhat agree\u2019 were then asked to give up to two reasons for their support, from \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019, \u2018unhealthy\u2019, \u2018mainly imported\u2019, \u2018high resource consumption\u2019 (in terms of land or water use for production for instance), \u2018high pesticide use\u2019, \u2018natural resources and biodiversity damage\u2019, \u2018unethical production\u2019, \u2018price not in line with its real value\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 (open response). Participants who answered \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 or \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 were then asked to give up to two reasons for their opposition among \u2018healthy\u2019, \u2018good nutritional quality\u2019, \u2018mainly produced in France\u2019, \u2018respect for the environment\u2019, \u2018price must not increase\u2019, \u2018concern over the fact that it would cover products that are too different\u2019 (e.g. many different products would be subject to a tax on products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score label (e.g. D or E)), \u2018infringement of consumer freedom of choice\u2019, \u2018not effective in reducing consumption\u2019, \u2018pretext to pay off public debt\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 (open answer). Participant characteristicsIndividual data reported by participants from the study period closest to the tax-related questionnaire (up to 2 years before or 1 year after the data collection for dietary intake) were used. Sociodemographic characteristics included sex (i.e. biological attribute [male/female]), age (years) categorised into five classes (18\u201330, 31\u201344, 45\u201354, 55\u201365, over 65), household income per month per consumption unit( 29 ) (CU) (\u20ac) categorised into four classes (less than \u20ac1300/month/CU, \u20ac1300\u20132600/month/CU, over \u20ac2600/month/CU, do not want to declare), education level categorised into three classes (no high school diploma, high school diploma, university degree), occupation, region of residence, marital status (married, in a couple, divorced/separated, widowed, single), number of persons in the household, child aged 0\u201313 years old in the household (yes/no) and adolescent aged 14\u201318 years old in the household (yes/no). The anthropometric characteristic was BMI (kg/m2) based on self-reported height and weight and categorised into four classes (under 18\u00b75 kg/m\u00b2, 18\u00b75\u201325 kg/m\u00b2, 25\u201330 kg/m\u00b2, over 30 kg/m\u00b2). As dietary intake data were not available for all participants, BMI was used as a proxy for dietary intake. Average daily intakes (g/d) of fatty products, sugary products, salty products, fatty and sugary products, fatty and salty products, meat, products with unfavourable Nutri-Score and UPF were assessed using the 24-h dietary records. Daily consumption was then categorised into two classes for each food group based on the corresponding median consumption in the sample (\u2264 median, > median). Statistical analysesFor each food tax, we derived nineteen dichotomous (yes/no) variables combining food tax acceptability and reasons in favour and against the food tax. All dichotomous variables are presented on the abscissa axis in online supplementary material, Supplemental Fig. S1. Responses from participants who neither agreed nor disagreed with a food tax were coded as \u2018no\u2019, as they were not asked to give the reasons for being in favour or against the food tax. Descriptive analysesWe computed numbers and percentages for all variables (participant characteristics, acceptability of food taxes, reasons in favour or against food taxes). Medians (Q1\u2013Q3) were described for participants\u2019 dietary intake. Identification of patterns of food taxes acceptabilityLatent class analysis was used to derive patterns of acceptability and reasons for acceptability of the eight hypothetical food taxes( 30 ). This method allows the identification of unobserved (i.e. latent) homogeneous patterns in a heterogeneous population using a process that considers an incremental number of classes (i.e. patterns). The selection of the optimal number of patterns was based on minimising the Akaike information criteria, the Bayesian information criteria (closest to 0), the posterior probabilities (> 80 %), the proportion of participants in each pattern (> 5 %) and the interpretation of the pattern( 30 ). Entropy (range 0\u20131), which represents the probability of each participant being in each pattern, was also computed to indicate how accurately the model defined the patterns( 30 ). Latent class analysis determines item-response probabilities (i.e. the probability that participants will select a particular response) conditional on pattern membership. Comparing item-response probabilities across patterns allows each identified pattern to be distinguished( 30 ). Cross-tabulations were used to describe the distribution (%) of food taxes acceptability according to identified patterns. Associations between participants\u2019 characteristics and patterns of food taxes acceptabilityAdjusted and unadjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to model the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric characteristics and dietary intake and patterns of food taxes acceptability. The most common pattern was used as a reference. OR, 95 % CI and adjusted column percentages are reported. Data were analysed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.) and PROC latent class analysis.

A total of 18\u00b73 and 11\u00b75 % of the participants agreed (strongly or somewhat) with taxes on fatty products and meat, respectively. The proposed UPF tax had the lowest level of ambivalence or uncertainty towards the tax; 86\u00b73 % of participants agreed or disagreed with the UPF tax and only 13\u00b77 % neither agreed nor disagreed. Figure 1.Description of taxes acceptability among all participants (weighted sample) (n 27 900). Reasons in favour and against food taxesThe distribution of reasons in favour and against food taxes is in Table 2 . Most of the participants indicated \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018unhealthy\u2019 as reasons in favour of all taxes except those of fatty products and meat. \u2018Unhealthy\u2019 and \u2018high resource consumption\u2019 were the most common reasons for supporting taxes on fatty products and meat, respectively. Reasons against the most accepted tax (i.e. UPF tax) were mainly \u2018not effective in reducing consumption\u2019, \u2018infringement of consumer freedom of choice and \u2018pretext to pay off public debt\u2019. For the least accepted taxes (i.e. fatty products and meat taxes), \u2018good nutritional quality\u2019 was the most frequently cited reason for disagreement.

Therefore, we elected a model with five patterns based on interpretability criteria. Identified patterns are presented in online supplementary material, Supplemental Fig. S1. The distribution of acceptability of food taxes according to the identified patterns is shown in Fig. 2 and online supplementary material, Supplemental Table S3. The patterns were labelled as follows:Pattern 1 (n 4728, 16\u00b79 %), labelled \u2018Support all food taxes\u2019: Participants in this pattern supported taxes on meat and fatty products for \u2018high resource consumption\u2019, \u2018unhealthy\u2019, \u2018natural resources and biodiversity damage\u2019 and \u2018unethical production\u2019 reasons and supported all other taxes for \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018unhealthy\u2019 reasons. Pattern 2 (n 8050, 28\u00b79 %), labelled \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019. Participants in this pattern were against taxes on meat and fatty products for \u2018good nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018healthy\u2019 reasons and supported all other taxes for \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018unhealthy\u2019 reasons\u2019. Pattern 3 (n 7384, 26\u00b75 %), labelled \u2018Against all but UPF, Nutri-Score and salty products taxes\u2019, included participants against taxes on fatty products, meat, fatty and salty products and fatty and sugary products for \u2018good nutritional quality\u2019, \u2018price must not increase\u2019, \u2018concern products that are too different\u2019, \u2018infringement of consumer freedom of choice\u2019 and \u2018inefficacity in reducing consumption\u2019 reasons. This pattern included participants in favour of taxes on UPF and products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score labelling for \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018unhealthy\u2019 reasons. Pattern 4 (n 2405, 8\u00b76 %), labelled \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019. Participants in this pattern were against all taxes for \u2018price must not increase\u2019, \u2018infringement of consumer freedom of choice\u2019, \u2018pretext to pay off public debt\u2019 and \u2018inefficacity in reducing consumption\u2019 reasons. A potential tax on UPF was slightly more accepted relatively to other taxes, for \u2018low nutritional quality\u2019 and \u2018unhealthy\u2019 reasons. Pattern 5 (n 5333, 19\u00b71 %), labelled \u2018No opinion\u2019. This pattern included participants who mostly neither agreed nor disagreed with all food taxes. Figure 2.Graphical representation of the distribution acceptability for food taxes according to identified patterns of food taxes acceptability (n 27 900). Pattern 1, \u2018Support all food taxes\u2019; Pattern 2, \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019; Pattern 3, \u2018Against all but UPF, Nutri-Score and salty products taxes\u2019; Pattern 4, \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019; Pattern 5, \u2018No opinion\u2019. Note: Patterns of food taxes acceptability were identified using latent class analysis. Figure 2 is the graphical representation of the numerical data presented in the online supplementary material, Supplemental Table S3. For each food tax, the proportions of participants who \u2018strongly disagree\u2019, \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019, \u2018neither agree nor disagree\u2019, \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 or \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 in each pattern are shown. For example, for the tax on fatty products, in Pattern 1, 8\u00b79 % of participants \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 (dark red zone), 18\u00b79 % \u2018somewhat disagree\u2019 (light red zone), 27\u00b70 % \u2018neither agree nor disagree\u2019 (grey zone), 19\u00b76 % \u2018somewhat agree\u2019 (light green zone) and 25\u00b76 % \u2018strongly agree\u2019 (dark green zone). Associations between participants\u2019 characteristics and patterns of food taxes acceptabilityGirl participants were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 (57\u00b73 %) pattern than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (52\u00b74 %) pattern (Table 4 ). Participants aged 18\u201330 years were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 (21\u00b74 %) pattern than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 pattern (11\u00b79 %). Participants with no high school diploma were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 (13\u00b70 %) and \u2018No opinion\u2019 (12\u00b79 %) patterns than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (7\u00b79 %). Participants with a child in the household were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 pattern (43\u00b74 %) than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (15\u00b79 %). Participants with BMI greater than 30 kg/m\u00b2 were more likely to be in the \u2018No opinion\u2019 (18\u00b75 %) and \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 (17\u00b75 %) patterns than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (9\u00b76 %). Participants consuming products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score labelling above the median were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 (52\u00b73 %) pattern than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (48\u00b73 %) (Table 4 ). Participants consuming meat above the median were less likely to be in the \u2018Support all food taxes\u2019 pattern (32\u00b73) than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (53\u00b71 %). The participants consuming UPF above the median were more likely to be in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 pattern (56\u00b70 %) than in the \u2018Support all but meat and fatty products taxes\u2019 (46\u00b74 %). Unadjusted results were similar (see online supplementary material, Supplemental Tables S4 and S5).

This subsample was weighted on sex, age, education level, occupation, region of residence and marital status according to the 2016 National Census.", "header": "RESULTS"}, {"body": "This study documented, in a large sample of the French adult population, that the acceptability of eight hypothetical food taxes varied according to the type of food subject to the tax. Specifically, taxes on UPF, salty products and products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score labelling were the most accepted, and taxes on meat and fatty products (including butter and cream) were the least accepted. Five patterns of food taxes acceptability were identified, highlighting that 8\u00b76 and 16\u00b79 % of participants were either against or in favour of most food taxes, respectively. Patterns of food taxes acceptability differed according to sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics and dietary intake. Participants in favour of taxes on meat and fatty products did so mainly for health and sustainability reasons. These reasons given by participants may be related to scientific evidence( 31 ). In addition, Godfray et al. showed that meat production, especially red meat, accounts for more than half of all greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change( 32 ), which is consistent with the accounting of livestock emissions of all greenhouse gases (at least 16\u00b75 %)( 33 ). In the present study, we examined the acceptability of meat in general, not specifically red or processed meat (which was rather included as an example of fatty and salty products). Participants may be more willing to accept a tax on red meat than on poultry, given their different environmental and health impacts( 6 , 31 , 32 ). In this way, in addition to the potentially beneficial health effects of taxing unhealthy foods, such taxes could have beneficial side effects such as reducing our environmental footprint and helping to \u2018green\u2019 our diets( 32 ). There are several reasons for the overall low acceptability of meat taxes. Meat consumption is influenced by beliefs and social and cultural dimensions( 34 ), which translate into different motives for consuming (or not consuming) meat( 35 ). Accordingly, with existing theory, our results reflect that meat consumption is viewed as necessary by participants, as they most often cited nutritional quality as a reason for being against a meat tax( 36 ). In addition to socio-cultural dimensions, the nutritional properties of meat could explain the high proportion of participants against meat tax( 37 ), as meat is a rich source of protein and iron( 37 ). The literature stated that the extent to which food taxes is likely to be acceptable matters because levels of acceptability may critically affect the effectiveness of such taxes in changing behaviour( 17 , 38 ). For example, participants in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 pattern could be less likely to change their dietary intake than participants in other patterns, given their low acceptability of all food taxes. However, participants in the \u2018Against all food taxes\u2019 pattern appeared to belong to population subgroups more likely to have poorer diet quality (e.g. consumed the highest quantity of products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score labelling and UPF) and thus more prone to further health problems. In addition, proportions of participants with a BMI > 30 kg/m\u00b2 (i.e. a proxy for dietary intake in our study) and without a high school diploma were highest in this pattern compared with other patterns, which are characteristics correlated with poor diet quality( 39 ). While improving dietary intake may be most needed among these participants, they are the ones for whom food taxes may be least effective. This underlines that the acceptability of food taxes may be explained by lifestyle habits( 34 ). Participants might be against food taxes because the foods that would be taxed and lead to price increases are the foods they usually buy and consume. The implementation of taxes on unhealthy food raises the question of its regressivity (i.e. the tax burden could decrease with income) and its effect on social inequalities( 40 ). Specifically, such taxes could disproportionately affect people with the lowest incomes, especially since they are the ones who consume most of the taxed products( 10 , 17 ). If people with the lowest incomes continue to consume unhealthy products even after a tax on them is implemented, the result could be a worsening of the gap in food budgets between those with lower and higher incomes. However, the results of a systematic review suggest that the regressivity of a food tax (a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages) could be relatively low( 41 ). A recent umbrella review also suggests that taxes on unhealthy foods may have a positive (i.e. reduction) or neutral effect on socio-economic inequalities in diet quality, with greater price elasticity reported in lower socio-economic groups( 42 ). Drawing a parallel with tobacco taxes, where the long-term data are more abundant than for food taxes, the literature suggests that tobacco taxes could reduce social inequalities in smoking( 43 ). The high number of participants with no opinion on food taxes (from 13\u00b77 to 35\u00b76 %) suggests that a relatively important part of the population would not be interested in debating such taxes. This could have policy implications, particularly with regard to the perceived risk that policymakers take in implementing a food tax and the communication that should accompany the implementation of food taxes. Given the large acceptability of a tax on UPF by the public (78\u00b70 % in favour), it could be less risky for the government to implement such a tax, and there would be a definite benefit in raising the issue of the UPF tax in the public debate. Notably, in France, mass media coverage and a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the deleterious health effects of UPF, in part prompted by scientific research, may contribute to the greater acceptability of the UPF tax than other food taxes. The results regarding meat underline the ambiguity between participants who support and those who oppose a meat food tax on health grounds( 44 ). It suggests more communication (the optimal modalities of which have yet to be fully explored( 45 )) to sensitise the population on and influence their behaviour beyond the \u2018price effect\u2019 that would be generated by taxes, especially the socially less advantaged part of the population. Considering the Nutri-Score front-of-pack nutrition label, its overall relatively high acceptability by participants (54\u00b76 % in favour) and the strong evidence of its beneficial health effects( 46 ), it would be appropriate and strategic to implement a food tax based on the Nutri-Score( 22 ). However, the current context in France, in particular with price inflation, may limit the implementation of such taxes. A combination of taxes on unhealthy foods and subsidies for other healthy and eco-friendly foods such as legumes, fruits and vegetables could be justified, increase public acceptability and limit potential inequalities( 10 , 47 ). In addition to public acceptance of taxes on meat (and on other food products), the feasibility of such taxes could be limited by lobbying activities( 48 ). Big food companies could influence policy and governance through their lobbying activities, in order to increase their power and influence and to maintain a favourable regulatory environment for their products( 48 ). For example, a tax on processed meat in the USA may not be politically feasible, although legally possible, because of the considerable political power of the processed meat industry through its lobbies( 49 ). Another concrete example is the world\u2019s first tax on saturated fats (including meat), introduced in Denmark in 2011( 50 ). The food industry lobby contributed to its repeal 15 months later using tactics such as threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses and questioning the evidence( 50 ). The findings of this study should be interpreted in the light of its limitations and strengths. First, the participants in the study (crude sample) had a higher level of education and higher income and were older than the general French adult population, which may limit the representativeness and generalisability of the results to other non-French populations. However, we weighted the study sample to limit this bias and the characteristics of the weighted sample approached those of the general French population in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Second, participants were asked to complete an initial questionnaire on sugar taxation \u2013 with items on the potential positive aspects of taxes \u2013 before answering the questionnaire in this study( 19 ). This may have had a priming effect on participants\u2019 acceptability of taxes in general, but the identification of the \u2018against all food taxes\u2019 pattern suggests that this bias was rather limited in magnitude. Third, as the questionnaire was sent to participants before the period of high inflation following COVID-19, extrapolation of the results to the current period is uncertain. It is possible that people\u2019s reactions to different taxes may be more critical in the context of an economic crisis. Fourth, it would have been interesting to examine the acceptability of food taxes at the same time as subsidies (e.g. for vegetables), but the questionnaire in our study only covered food taxes. Fifth, there was no example or definition of UPF in the questionnaire, but the latter aimed to measure the spontaneous reaction to a possible tax on UPF among the public regardless of their level of literacy on the subject. In addition, our team\u2019s research showing associations with disease risk (e.g. CVD and type 2 diabetes( 4 )) has helped to make the concept of UPF well known and highly visible to the general public. It is therefore likely that the general public has a relatively accurate idea of the overall definition of the UPF concept. Lastly, the cross-sectional design did not allow for causal inferences. Strengths include the national and large study sample, the variety of potential food taxes examined and the combination of both acceptability and reasons for acceptability of food taxes in the analyses. ConclusionsThis study evidenced that among eight hypothetical food taxes, participants were most in favour of taxes on UPF, salty products and products with an unfavourable Nutri-Score labelling and most against taxes on meat and fatty products (added fats) in a large sample of French adults. Five patterns of food taxes acceptability were identified, with a total of 8\u00b76 and 16\u00b79 % of the participants belonging to the patterns against and in favour of all food taxes, respectively. Participants against all food taxes were more likely to be from lower socio-economic status, with a high BMI and with poor diet quality than participants in the other patterns. The findings will be of interest to policymakers in the design of food taxes and suggest further research to identify levers that could improve the acceptability of all food taxes across the adult population, especially those from lower socio-economic status.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}, {"body": "Manneville et al. supplementary material 1Manneville et al. supplementary material Manneville et al. supplementary material 2Manneville et al. supplementary material", "header": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

Since 1980, more than 60 000 refugees have relocated to the town and its surrounding area. The first wave of refugees to resettle in the area were refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. Refugee resettlement to the community increased significantly in the 1990s \u2013 the community\u2019s foreign-born population was 9 % in 1990 and doubled by 1995. This community became a prime resettlement location based on the surrounding city\u2019s robust economic growth, while the smaller community has affordable housing options, access to public transportation and proximity to downtown Atlanta. By 2023, nearly half of residents are foreign-born, with more than 150 ethnic groups and sixty languages spoken( 27 ). This demographic context may entail specific dietary practices among adolescents because, unlike many cities across the USA, diverse food environments are easily accessible within a 1-mile radius. This study was part of a larger project focused on identifying ways in which refugees assimilate into their new communities and how assimilation may affect their risk of obesity and diabetes. We partnered with a refugee resettlement organisation that runs an afterschool programme providing social and academic support to refugee youth as they adapt to life in the USA. During each academic year, four cohorts of 20\u201330 students participated in the programme. The programme is for students 10\u201317 years of age within 1 year of arrival and is delivered over 6 weeks. We conducted data collection from November 2017 to May 2018 with three cohorts of the after-school programme. All seventy-five adolescents enrolled in the programme were invited to participate in this study, and all agreed to participate. Due to migration away from the area and incomplete attendance by the students in this optional programme, we have complete data for sixty-eight students and partial data for seven more. Characteristics of the newly arrived refugee adolescents participating in the after-school programme are shown in Table 1 . Adolescents were from nine countries of origin. Thirty-seven (49 %) had spent some time in a refugee camp prior to migration to the USA. Fifty (66\u00b77 %) were from either Afghanistan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. The average time since arrival was 5\u00b74 months, with 1 year being the longest an adolescent in the programme had lived in the USA. We did not collect data on religion or ethnicity at to our community partner\u2019s request.

Data and methodsWe rely on methods from cognitive anthropology to generate food and beverage lists (i.e. freelisting) and to determine whether youths grouped these foods into similar clusters (i.e. pilesorting)( 28 ). We postulate that young people who categorise food and beverages in a similar fashion may be drawing on a shared cultural model, or belief set, when deciding how to categorise items. As defined by Cultural Model Theory, culture refers to mental knowledge shared by a social group that may or may not be territorially defined; expanding this idea, cultural models refer to constitutive knowledge or belief sets related to a theme( 29 ). If adolescents\u2019 cultural models differ by gender or country of origin or other characteristics, then resettlement programming around health and nutrition will need to be tailored for these groups. From an empirical lens, investigating the cultural models that adolescents hold around food and eating behaviours may shed light on the social mechanisms of dietary change and related health outcomes after migration. As outlined in detail below, we conducted structured freelist interviews with a subsample of adolescents to generate a list of foods and beverages that they consumed before and after moving to the USA (n=26). Freelist interviews identified culturally relevant foods and beverages to include in our analysis. Preserving the thirty-two most frequently listed items, we generated a set of picture cards, conducted a pilesort activity with a different group of adolescents (n 68) and interviewed them about how they sorted the cards. Through the pilesort technique, we aim to assess whether adolescents agree about who eats certain types of foods and beverages. This is a step towards an exploration of how adolescents sort between parent and child-specific food and beverage items \u2013 a topic to be studied in future analyses. Finally, we conducted cultural consensus and regression analyses to examine factors that inform differences in how adolescents conceptualise and categorise food and beverage items. Instrument developmentWith guidance and feedback from our community partner, we developed freelist and pilesort instruments (described below) to evaluate lifestyle changes. In the summer of 2017, we met with caseworkers, nutrition educators and other staff at the resettlement organisation to determine key aspects they wanted to glean from the project. We adapted a freelist instrument from our previous work with refugee adults at the point of green card status in the same city at one refugee resettlement office 2016 through 2017(30). In adapting instruments, we conducted cognitive interviews with three immigrant adolescents of the same age range as adolescents enrolled in the afterschool programme. With the first cohort of students (n 26), we evaluated English proficiency and establish how to integrate research into the programme (pre-test cohort). We pre-tested the revised instruments again with three new students. We created a demographic intake sheet with information about age (years), date of arrival in the USA, country of origin, household composition and whether they had ever lived in a refugee camp. The youth programme supervisor filled this form out for every student after consent from parents was received. All instruments were developed in English and were administered in the language of each adolescent\u2019s choice by an interpreter. We were not able to translate instruments in advance, as the programme coordinators did not know in advance which youths would be arriving and consequently which languages would be spoken; therefore, we used our community partner\u2019s interpreters who were already at the school for the programme. A study team interviewer worked with each interpreter and recroded. The answers in English based on the interpreter\u2019s translation. FreelistingFreelisting is a semi-structured interview method that asks participants to name all the items they can think of for a particular domain; in this study, the domain of interest was food and beverages consumed( 28 ). Generally, respondents list first the items most familiar, or salient, to them. Items that are frequently listed across individuals tend to appear early in individual lists. We developed a freelist questionnaire that asked participants to list three food and beverage items for two prompts: (1) \u2018What are things you eat or drink very often now that you rarely ate or drank before you came to the United States?\u2019 and (2) \u2018Tell me things that you ate or drank most frequently before coming to the United States that you rarely eat now\u2019. These prompts were asked among the pre-test cohort of the programme (n=26; cohort 1). From the thirty-two most frequently listed foods and beverages generated through the freelists (further delineated in Table 2 ), we created a set of picture cards for pilesort exercises (Table 3 ). The final picture cards of foods and beverages were also informed by trips to grocery stores in the area, previous data from adult refugees in the same community( 28 ), discussions with the nutrition educator at the resettlement organisation, and caseworkers at two other resettlement organisations in the area. The thirty-two foods and beverages picture cards were placed on laminated cards for data collection (see Appendix Fig. A.1 for pictures of all cards).

White Rice (homemade) PilesortingIn the pilesorting method, participants sort cards created from the freelist into categories based on their own perceptions and preferences. Pilesorts allow researchers to identify which items people think relate to each other; this method gives insights into participants\u2019 conceptual models, in this case those related to food( 28 ). To initiate an unconstrained pilesort, the interviewer asked each adolescent to arrange the shuffled deck of thirty-two cards into categories however he or she wanted. This method was used to identify differences in food groupings. Adolescents were required to make at least two piles, each pile containing at least two cards, but no limit was placed on the number of piles. Interviewers emphasised there were no correct answers. After the cards were sorted into categories, interviewers asked adolescents to explain the piles created. The interviewers elicited names for each pile with pre-scripted questions \u2018Why do these foods and drinks belong together?\u2019; responses were recorded verbatim as pile names. The adolescents then completed a second pilesort exercise called a constrained pilesort pertaining to perceived generational differences in foods. The interviewer asked each participant to organise the deck of thirty cards into a pile for \u2018what parents eat or drink\u2019, a pile for \u2018what kids eat or drink\u2019 and a pile for \u2018what both parents and kids eat or drink\u2019; if a card did not belong, it would be placed in a fourth \u2018don\u2019t belong\u2019 pile. After the cards were sorted into groups, interviewers asked participants to explain why cards were placed into the respective piles and verbatim recorded participants\u2019 responses. Analytic methodsTo analyse freelist data, we calculated the frequency with which adolescents listed each item. Some of the items were collapsed into broader, culturally relevant items( 28 ). For example, brand names such as \u2018Coca-Cola\u2019 were collapsed into the item \u2018Soda\u2019. The decision to collapse an item was informed by discussions with caseworkers, nutrition educators and other staff at the resettlement organisation and the responses of participants. To analyse pilesort data, we used cultural consensus analysis, exploratory multidimensional scaling (MDS) and regression analyses. The pilesorts were analysed with Visual Anthropac( 31 ). As part of exploratory data analysis, MDS plots illustrate spatial patterns of proximity in a pilesort task \u2013 that is, they provide a graphic depiction of the aggregate grouping of items. To derive coordinates for the MDS plot, item-by-item aggregate proximity matrices were generated. Stress level, which is a goodness-of-fit measure, was calculated for all MDS plots. Larger stress levels indicate poorer fit. For a thirty-item matrix scaled in two dimensions, a stress level below 0\u00b73 is considered acceptable and suggests only a 1 % chance of items in the MDS plot being randomly arranged( 32 ). Using Anthropac, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis on food items to assess grouping within the domains. Clusters are partitioned using the aggregate proximity matrix data. The clustered terms signify different domains of thought related to the sorting exercise. To determine the optimal number of clusters to reach cluster homogeneity and to interpret cluster meaning, we compared clustering at different partition levels( 33 ). We assigned clusters numbers to assist with interpretation. The ordinal position of clusters relative to one another is arbitrary. For enhanced visualisation, the food item coordinate data and clusters calculated in Visual Anthropac were exported to R (R Core Team, 2014). Using coordinate data, plots were produced in R using scatterplot functionality available with the ggplot2 package( 34 ). We adopted principles from cognitive anthropology to calculate cultural competence measures using cultural consensus analysis for both constrained and unconstrained pilesorts( 28 ). Cultural consensus analysis measures the reliability of participant responses in relation to one another and the overall group. Through this process, participants are assigned measures for how accurately their given domain corresponds to the domain in the group. Therefore, cultural competence measures indicate how close individual participants were to the cultural domain of the group. The higher the competence score, the more an individual\u2019s piles matched the cultural consensus of the whole group. For cultural consensus analysis, an eigenvalue ratio of at least 3:1 is considered evidence of a single, shared cultural model; a ratio of 4:1 is sometimes used as a more stringent cut-off( 35 ). Linear regression models were run with competence as the outcome and covariates being age (continuous), gender (male, female), region (Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)), Middle East (Afghanistan, Syria), Asia (Bhutan, Burma)), number of siblings (continuous) and lived in a refugee camp prior to US arrival (yes, no). STATA 17.0 was used for regression analyses. We ran a separate model for constrained and unconstrained pilesort competence measures. We do not include length of time in the USA in models because all respondents were within 1 year of arrival. Several participants were from the same household, for example, siblings or cousins living together (thirty-eight households total); therefore, as a sensitivity analyses, we re-estimated the MDS plots and competence measures with only one adolescent per household selected randomly.", "header": "METHODS"}, {"body": "Foods refugee adolescents stopped and started eating after migrationOver half of adolescents (n 26) reported no longer having certain foods and drinks they used to have before migration to the USA (58 %) (Table 2 ). They listed an average of 2\u00b78 foods and drinks they had stopped eating, with a range of 1\u20135 items listed. Rice, beans and potatoes were the top three items listed as no longer eaten. A larger number of adolescents reported adopting new foods and drinks since living in the USA (61 %), listing on average 2\u00b79 foods and drinks they had started consuming, with a range of 1\u20137 items listed. Pizza, chicken and apple were the top three items listed as newly adopted. Refugee adolescents exhibit consensus about food groupsItems grouping created by the adolescents yielded four themes, qualitatively described by the adolescents as \u2018American foods\u2019, \u2018Snacks and Drinks\u2019, \u2018Dense or Heavy Foods\u2019 and \u2018Fruits\u2019 (Fig. 1 ). Cluster 1 (American Foods) consisted of fourteen food items: pizza, fries, chips, candy, fish, roasted potatoes, kale, tacos, cheeseburger, frozen fish, granola bars, bread, goldfish and Lunchables. This cluster has some overlap with cluster 2 due to a lack of consensus in the placement of goldfish and Lunchables. Cluster 2 (Snacks and Drinks) consisted of ten items: rice crisps, string cheese, regular cheese, pickles, Gogosqueez apple sauce, chocolate milk, Gogurt, Coke, juice and milk. The proximity of beverages to one another even within the cluster highlights that beverages were frequently grouped together. Both cluster 1 and 2 spatially took up a lot of the axes, indicating not as much consensus as clusters 3 and 4. Cluster 3 (Dense or Heavy Foods) consisted of three items: pasta, nuts and black beans. Cluster 4 (Fruits) consisted of three items: mango, kiwi and avocado. Items in Cluster 3 and 4 were consistently grouped together, and consensus was high. The MDS stress level suggests this domain structure was not random (stress = 0\u00b7221), and the eigenvalue ratio was 3\u00b726, indicating that young people shared their understanding of how these foods \u2018should\u2019 be sorted. In robustness checks, when evaluating only one adolescent per household (Appendix Fig. A.2), four similar groups still emerged; the MDS stress level and eigenvalue ratio also still suggested that this domain structure is not random (stress = 0\u00b7211; eigenvalue ratio: 5\u00b731). Figure 1.Multidimensional scaling plot (stress = 0\u00b7221) and cluster analysis for adolescents\u2019 (n 68) unconstrained pilesorts of thirty foods and beverages. Note: 1: American Foods; 2: Snacks and Drinks; 3: Dense Foods; 4: Fruits. Constrained pilesort- \u2018American Foods\u2019 identified for both parents and adolescentsWhen subsequently prompted to sort the picture cards into item for, kids, or both, the adolescents\u2019 grouping yielded four clusters (Fig. 2 ). Cluster 1 (both Parents and Adolescents) consisted of six items: tacos, cheeseburger, roasted potatoes, French fries and pizza. This cluster had some overlap with cluster 2, which was a catchall for items the adolescents felt did not belong in any group (Don\u2019t Belong) and which consisted of beverages: coke, juice and milk, perhaps suggesting that the youth did not conceptualise of beverages in terms of generational consumption. Cluster 3 \u2013 Parent Foods \u2013 consisted of eight items: mango, pasta, black beans, avocado, nuts, kiwi, kale and fish. Cluster 4 \u2013Kids Stuff \u2013 had thirteen items: candy, chips, Lunchables, chocolate milk, Gogurt, GogoSqueez, rice crisps, granola bars, string cheese, cheese, bread and pickles. Cluster 3 and 4 were spatially the furthest apart from one another, with Cluster 1 being in the middle, indicating that parent and kid food and drink designations are distinct and items for both groups are clustered among them. The MDS stress level suggests this domain structure was not random (stress = 0\u00b7190), and the eigenvalue ratio was 6\u00b708, indicating that young people shared in their understanding of how these foods relate to one another.

When evaluating only one adolescent per household (Appendix Fig. A.3), the groups were slightly different but consistent spatially; the MDS stress level and eigenvalue ratio also still indicated that this domain structure is not random (stress = 0\u00b7224; eigenvalue ratio: 5\u00b725). These results indicate that, in general, adolescents within 1 year of arrival to the USA agree on which foods are conceived of being related. Food consensus and refugee camp experienceWe fit two regression models to assess what characteristics of participants were most associated with competence, that is, with sharing the overall group mental model (Table 4 ). When evaluating individual agreement with the unconstrained groupings of food and beverages (i.e. general differences in food groupings), there were no differences in how adolescents grouped the cards by gender, age, number of siblings or region of origin. Those who had lived in a camp prior to arrival exhibited more competence or agreement, grouping items more like the answers of the overall group compared with those who did not live in a camp (\u03b2 (95 % CI); 0\u00b722 (0\u00b702, 0\u00b743)). However, in the constrained groupings focused on generational allocation of items, adolescents from countries in the Middle Eastern region exhibited less agreement in grouping items for adults and children more similarly to the cultural consensus answers compared with adolescents from countries in Africa (\u20130\u00b724 (\u20130\u00b742, \u20130\u00b704)).

We also evaluated these competence measures with a subsample of one adolescent per household (n 38). In grouping foods in the unconstrained exercise, the association with having lived in a camp was the same in the constrained exercise. Adolescents who had lived in a refugee camp prior to migration exhibited more agreement to the overall responses (0\u00b727 (0\u00b7005, 0\u00b754).", "header": "RESULTS"}, {"body": "Research examining the meaning of foods emphasises shared norms and beliefs about food and ways of eating within groups. We expanded this research by examining refugee adolescents\u2019 cultural models of food in their new environment of resettlement, hypothesising that adolescents from diverse backgrounds and experiences would nonetheless exhibit shared cultural models when they resettled in a shared environment. We evaluated what foods and drinks adolescents stopped and started consuming after migration. Many reported eating new foods and drinks (61 %) and no longer consuming others (58 %). New food and drinks included both healthy (apples and oranges) and potentially unhealthy items (pizza). Foods frequently listed as no longer eaten included rice and beans but also some items that are typically perceived and named by adolescents as \u2018American\u2019, including pizza, soda and chocolate milk. Dietary acculturation does not necessitate a wholesale change towards unhealthy foods( 36 , 37 ). Alternatively, no longer eating certain foods after migration can possibly be attributed to a lack of resources for acquiring these foods, or a desire to protect one\u2019s ethnic identity through preserving foodways. Using methods from cognitive anthropology, we found that adolescents who had recently moved to a city in the Southeastern USA on a refugee visa shared a cultural model about which foods are grouped together, including fruits, meal items, snacks and drinks. There was agreement across gender, age and number of siblings. Children in the same household had similar shared cultural models within the larger group. Children who had lived in a refugee camp were more likely to identify the general piles of items to be like the shared cultural model. These results are consistent with previous findings that shared environments lead young people to converge on similar understandings about foods( 18 , 38 ). Adolescents showed consensus in grouping items in general and in specifying generational food differences. The cultural model of eating practices was shared across age, gender and number of siblings. Adolescents had all been in the USA for less than a year and come from diverse settings, yet they already exhibit a shared understanding of how foods relate to one another. Specifically, adolescents mention distinct groups or typologies of foods or identify foods consumed differently across generational strata. Adolescents who had lived in a refugee camp were different in how they grouped items together in general (unconstrained) pilesort. They were more likely to group items like the overall shared model for the unconstrained pilesort compared with adolescents who had not lived in a refugee camp. It is possible that the allocation of food supplies to families in camps would make general item grouping applicable to the adolescents\u2019 experiences regardless of camp status. Our framing suggests that competence in this sense simply refers to how much an individual agrees with a norm established by a group. In this case, the norm is established by a group of adolescents with varied backgrounds who agree on how food and beverage items relate to one another. Our study provides preliminary insight into the processes of dietary acculturation among refugee adolescents during the first months of living in the USA. Adolescents in our sample share cultural models about generational preferences of foods. The extent to which these beliefs drive dietary choices among parents and adolescents was not examined. Our finding that adolescents who recently arrived in the USA generally agree about how foods relate to one another holds promise for nutrition and dietary interventions that engage with diverse adolescent groups. Researchers may glean more nuanced understanding of what drives dietary beliefs through qualitative or ethnographic research with adolescents and their caregivers. Few studies have evaluated health behaviours post-migration among adolescent refugees. One study among immigrant and refugee adolescents (ages 12\u201317) in a school in North Carolina evaluated participants from thirty-five countries who had lived in the USA for less than a year( 39 , 40 ). The study determined that fruit, milk, fruit juice, soda and meat consumption increased post-arrival( 39 ). Furthermore, camp experience, sex, ethnicity and BMI were associated with these dietary changes( 40 ). That study did not differentiate between immigrant and refugee adolescents and focused on reported consumption v. the cultural models of food selection pre- and post-arrival. Pilesort methods have been utilised previosly, however, not with refugee adolescents. One pilesort study among low-income women in Santos, Brazil, asked about food categorisation( 41 ). Among ninety women, six clusters arose: home meals, convenience foods, special meals, fish, breads and cereals, and hot dogs. Rationales for food categories included frequency of consumption, degree of healthfulness, personal taste and meals in which the food was included ( 42 ). Among urban and rural caregivers in Sri Lanka, food classification highlighted a \u2018hot\u2019 and cold\u201d paradigm reflecting Ayurvedic medical belief system( 42 ). Limitations and contextThere are several limitations to this study. Unexplored factors, including food security, availability, accessibility, agency and intrahousehold dynamics, shape decisions around diet. For this study, we focus on beliefs surrounding food as a window into food preferences. The nature of our sampling and community partnership means all students attend the same school. This may entail that the cultural models of food are established in the school environment and thus do not develop individually as part of resettlement. Furthermore, some critics have argued that formal cognitive models of culture are limited and that cut-offs for what counts as \u2018consensus\u2019 are arbitrary( 43 ). The cards we developed did not fully encompass all items listed by our freelist exercise. There may be less consensus around certain items than others because they will be more familiar to youths from some places of origin than for others. Due to the sample size, our country-of-origin categories are very broad and encompass large regions of the world. Participants included in these categories had diverse and unique experiences that we are not able to disentangle. We have no information on participant\u2019s ethnic identity within their country of origin as well as any religious affiliation, as these were items our community partners requested we not discuss with the youths. Ethnic identity and religious affiliation could entail cultural differences that may have implications for our results. For example, Afghanistan has at least fourteen major ethnolinguistic groups that differ in terms of diet, among other factors. ConclusionsOur study expands the applications of cognitive theories of culture to illuminate processes of dietary acculturation in the USA among adolescent refugees within 1 year of arrival. It demonstrates that foods commonly consumed change within months of resettlement. Based on our findings of a shared cultural model, nutrition programming efforts with adolescents may be generalisable across refugee origin groups. Our work also offers insights into how adolescents categorise the food landscape into adult foods and children\u2019s foods. Adolescent\u2019s classifications indicates that many healthy food options are not considered to be in the domains of children and teens.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}, {"body": "Jones-Antwi et al. supplementary materialJones-Antwi et al. supplementary material", "header": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

Through large-scale genetic association studies, a link between single nucleotide polymorphisms and disease susceptibility and severity was established. However, individual single nucleotide polymorphisms identified thus far have shown modest effects, indicating a polygenic nature of this trait, and individually have limited predictive performance. To address this limitation, we investigated the performance of a polygenic risk score model in the context of COVID-19 severity in a Russian population. A genome-wide polygenic risk score model including information from over a million common single nucleotide polymorphisms was developed using summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative consortium. Low-coverage sequencing (5x) was performed for ~1000 participants, and polygenic risk score values were calculated for each individual. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyse the association between polygenic risk score and COVID-19 outcomes. We found that individuals in the top 10% of the polygenic risk score distribution had a markedly elevated risk of severe COVID-19, with adjusted odds ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.8\u20134.6, p-value = 4e-06), and more than four times higher risk of mortality from COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio = 4.3, p-value = 2e-05). This study highlights the potential of polygenic risk score as a valuable tool for identifying individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 based on their genetic profile.", "sections": {"chapters": [{"body": "COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a contagious illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The majority of individuals who contract the virus exhibit mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and can recover without requiring specific medical treatment. However, in certain cases, the disease can manifest in a severe form, requiring medical intervention [ 1 , 2 ]. Apart from external factors such as virus characteristics and the effectiveness of healthcare, certain host-related factors such as increasing age, male gender, and pre-existing chronic diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes have been associated with susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 [ 3 , 4 ]. However, these risk factors alone cannot fully explain the wide variation observed in the disease severity, which can range from asymptomatic cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death [ 5 \u2013 7 ]. To gain insights into the aetiology of COVID-19, large-scale genetic association studies including both rare and common genetic variants have employed various study designs. These investigations, along with subsequent follow-up studies, have expanded our understanding of the disease and provided potential avenues for its treatment. The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) was established to investigate the role of human genetics in the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 [ 8 ]. This global effort aims to conduct a meta-analysis of multiple COVID-19 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Combining genetic data from up to 49562 cases and 2 million controls across 19 countries through case\u2013control meta-analyses, these studies have implicated a total of 13 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with COVID-19-related traits [ 9 ]. Several of these loci represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection, such as innate antiviral immune signalling, regulation of organ-specific inflammatory responses, and upregulation of cell receptors [ 10 , 11 ]. The effects of individual genetic variants identified so far are generally small, consistent with the polygenic architecture. An individual who tests negative for a specific genetic risk variant may still have a high genetic risk due to other unmeasured genetic factors. While every single variant only explains a small portion of the risk for severe COVID-19, combining multiple genetic variants into a polygenic risk score (PRS) can offer a better prediction of the risk. PRS allows for the aggregation of the effects of multiple SNPs into a single score, which can be practically applied to individuals within a population [ 12 ]. Conventionally, a polygenic score is defined as a weighted linear combination of allele counts for SNPs observed in an individual\u2019s genome [ 13 ]. Several studies have explored the development and evaluation of PRS for potential clinical applications, revealing that PRS is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, most of these studied cohorts consisting predominantly of individuals of Western European ancestry [ 15 \u2013 17 ]. Using 1582 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants from the UK Biobank (1018 with severe COVID-19 and 564 without severe COVID-19) and 64 SNPs for PRS calculation, Dite et al. developed and validated a clinical and genetic model for predicting the risk of severe COVID-19. Only 13% of participants from this study were non-European, and the model including PRS alone had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.68 [ 17 ]. While one recent study included African and South Asian groups, the associations with COVID-19 outcomes were limited by applying a PRS based on only six SNPs [ 18 ]. Another study that considered non-Western European populations was constrained by its focus on a specific Russian cohort (athletes) and also included only six genetic polymorphisms in the PRS assessment [ 19 ]. The multi-ethnic approach implemented in a recent paper using UK Biobank data allowed the application of PRS, based on 17 SNPs, to diverse populations, where a PRS model showed meaningful prediction performance across Black and Asian cohorts [ 20 , 21 ]. While the study\u2019s findings suggest that PRS may have the potential as a predictive marker for COVID-19 severity and support their potential use in risk stratification and personalized healthcare approaches, the limitations of these studies underscore the need for further research to enhance the predictive capability of PRS in the context of COVID-19. Our study aimed to investigate the performance of the PRS model in the Russian population. The genomes of study participants (319 individuals with severe COVID-19 and 663 with moderate or without disease) were assessed using low-coverage (with a mean depth of 5x) sequencing. Next, we developed a genome-wide PRS model for COVID-19 severity using the summary statistics from the HGI consortium. We demonstrated that PRS, incorporating information from more than a million common genetic variants, can identify individuals with markedly elevated risk of severe COVID-19 course: adjusted OR = 2.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8\u20134.6, p-value = 4e-06) for individuals in the top 10% of the PRS distribution, and can moderately improve the quality of prediction (AUC increased from 0.68 to 0.71) compared to a model including only demographic and clinical information.", "header": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"body": "Study participants and genetic sequencingAs part of the COVID-19 study, biomaterial (blood) and clinical data from COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the infectious disease department of the St. Petersburg State Budgetary Healthcare Institution \u2018City Hospital No. 40 of Kurortny District\u2019 were collected. For each participant, retrospective and prospective access to electronic health data was available, including the Hospital Information System (HIS). In this work, low-coverage sequencing with an average coverage of 5x was performed for 1101 individuals divided into 41 batches. Low-coverage sequencing, also called low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS), is a low-cost, high-throughput DNA sequencing technology used to accurately detect genetic variation in the genomes of multiple species [ 22 ]. LP-WGS is the type of WGS with genome coverage from 0.5x to 5x [ 23 , 24 ]. Using imputation algorithms, this technology provides high variant detection accuracy with low sequence coverage. LP-WGS and subsequent imputation yields, across the genome, more accurate genotypes than imputation using array-based genotyping data, allowing for increased power in GWAS studies and more accurate results in polygenic risk prediction [ 25 ]. Before sequencing, a preliminary analysis and quality control of the data were performed. This was followed by a preprocessing stage that used blocking and randomization techniques to design sequencing batches to reduce potential biases and ensure an even distribution of sample characteristics, such as age, sex, and case/control status. Genomic DNA isolation was performed with QIAcube, using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA concentration was measured with a Promega QuantiFluor dsDNA System. Library preparation was done using an MGIEasy FS DNA Library Prep Set. Sequencing was done on an MGISEQ-2000 sequencing machine with the DNBSEQ-G400RS high-throughput sequencing set (FCL PE150, 540 G). Variant calling, imputation, and quality controlQuality control (FastQC, version 0.11.9) [ 26 ], alignment (BWA, version 0.7.17) [ 27 ], deduplication (samtools, version 1.16.1), and variant calling (bcftools, version 1.16) were performed for the reads obtained from sequencing [ 28 ]. Imputation of the resulting data was then performed using the GLIMPSE tool (version 1.1.1) [ 29 ], which allowed the imputation of low-coverage sequencing data. To improve the imputation quality, only bi-allelic sites were retained from the LP-WGS BAM data and processed with bcftools. Then iterative refinement of the genotype likelihood using the reference panels with a segmentation size of 2 Mb with a buffer size of 200 kb produced imputed dosages, and multiple chunks within each chromosome were ligated. A panel of the 1000 Genomes Project with high coverage [ 30 ], including high-quality single nucleotide variants and insertion-deletion mutations (SNV- and INDELs) from over 3000 individuals, was used as a reference sample. Subsequently, variants with an INFO score below 0.7 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.1% were excluded from the analysis, following established protocols [ 9 , 13 ]. After applying filters for variant and individual call rates above 90%, five participants were removed. Genetic sex was inferred based on X chromosome heterozygosity using PLINK\u2019s implementation, where individuals with heterozygosity estimates (F) less than 0.2 were classified as female and those with F greater than 0.8 were classified as male. A total of 24 participants with discordant genetic sex were excluded. First- and second-degree relatives were identified using the KING-robust method [ 31 ] and removed from the analysis, with a kinship threshold of 0.125. This step resulted in the exclusion of 32 participants (one member of each pair). The analysis was then restricted to a list of HapMap3 variants [ 32 ] included in the PRS models. All genotype extraction and quality control procedures were performed using PLINK 1.90 software [ 33 ]. Establishing COVID-19 severityThe criteria for a mild course of COVID-19 were defined as having a body temperature below 38\u00b0C, cough, weakness, sore throat, and the absence of indicators characteristic of a moderate or severe course. A moderate course of COVID-19 was characterized by fever with a temperature above 38\u00b0C, a respiratory rate greater than 22 breaths per minute, shortness of breath, pneumonia as detected by computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 95%. Severe disease was clinically and radiologically defined by a respiratory rate exceeding 30 breaths per minute, SpO2 < 93%, PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg, progression of changes in the lungs characteristic of COVID-19, and pneumonia as indicated by CT data, including an increase in the prevalence of identified changes by more than 25%. Additional criteria for severe disease included the appearance of signs of other pathological conditions, changes in the level of consciousness, unstable haemodynamics (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mm Hg, and urine output less than 20 ml/h), and a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score > 2 points. Lastly, the criteria for an extremely severe course included signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring respiratory support (invasive ventilation), septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Ascertainment of covariatesThe covariates of the present study were as follows: age, sex, and comorbidities, including myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral artery disease (PAD), cerebrovascular disease (CD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and kidney damage. The information pertaining to the comorbidities was derived from the electronic medical records. The first ten principal genetic components (PCs) were also included as covariates to adjust for population genetic structures and avoid bias, as per current recommendations [ 13 ]. The computation of PCs was done by PLINK 1.90 software, via the \u2013 pca option [ 33 ]. In addition to genetic quality control measures, 58 participants were excluded from the analysis because information on their clinical parameters was missing and could not be obtained. As a result, the rate of missing values for any comorbidity is 0%. Construction of PRS modelsThe calculation of PRS values relies on both genotype data from the target individuals and a PRS model. To derive a PRS model, GWAS are used to estimate the effect sizes of SNPs [ 34 ]. However, a GWAS gives the marginal effect size for each SNP estimated by a regression model that ignores linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure. As a result, to construct a PRS model that incorporates multiple SNPs, the SNP effects must be re-estimated while accounting for LD structure. We used the GWAS from the COVID-19 HGI consortium (release 7). These results were obtained by the meta-analysis that combined the results of 60 individual studies from 25 countries, with a total of 18000 severe cases of COVID-19 and more than a million controls who either did not have a severe disease course or were not affected by COVID-19 during the study period. To re-weight the effect sizes, we used SBayesR (version gctb_2.02), a powerful Bayesian tool that uses summary statistics from GWAS [ 14 ]. This tool re-weights the effects of each genetic variant based on the marginal estimate of its effect size, statistical strength of association, the degree of correlation between the variant and other variants nearby, and tuning parameters. We used the default values for tuning parameters. It also requires a GCTB-compatible LD matrix file based on individual-level data from a reference population, and for this analysis, we used a shrunk sparse GCTB LD matrix from 50000 individuals of European ancestry in the UK Biobank dataset [ 35 ]. PRS values were calculated as a weighted sum of allele counts: where is the re-weighted effect size of the SNP, is the genotype of the SNP for individual, and N is the number of SNPs from the model. PLINK 1.90 software [ 33 ] was used for PRS calculation (via the \u2013 score option). Statistical analysis and association testingLogistic regression of COVID-19 outcomes on PRS was then conducted using R (version 4.3.2) [ 36 ] and Python (version 3.8.17) [ 37 ], adjusted for covariates (sex, age, comorbidities, and the first ten PCs). The discriminative power of models in identifying high-risk individuals was then assessed using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC (AUC) was calculated for full models (consisting of covariates and PRS) and base models (covariates-only). Because of limited sample size, we used the stratified k-fold cross-validator (k = 5) to estimate a mean AUC for each logistic regression model. The confidence interval for the AUC was calculated using the formula given by Hanley and McNeil [ 38 ]. Increment in AUC (\u0394AUC) was reported based on the difference between the two models, reported as the discriminative or predictive power conferred by PRS. The bootstrap procedure for differences between classifiers was used to calculate the significance (p-value) of an increment in AUC. Once the PRS was calculated, individuals were separately stratified into quintiles for PRS. Next, they were categorized into low genetic risk (decile 1, bottom 10% of cohort), intermediate risk (decile 2\u20139, middle 80%), and high risk (decile 10, top 10%). For each group, we applied the non-parametric Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator [ 39 ] to estimate the cumulative density curve and the log-rank test (with other groups used as a reference), which is the statistical test for comparing the survival distributions of two or more groups. Participants\u2019 birthdates were considered the starting point, and their respective enrolment dates in the study served as the endpoint. For this analysis, COVID-19 outcomes (severe cases or death due to COVID-19) were defined as events, while all other observations were treated as censored data. We performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis for the whole cohort using PRS values, sex, comorbidities, and the first ten principal components of genetic variation as parameters. To compare survival with changes in PRS, we plotted the partial effects of PRS on outcome, where we fixed the values of the covariates and used the mean PRS values in each of the three groups described above. The survival analysis was performed using Python (version 3.8.17) [ 37 ].", "header": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"body": "Participant characteristicsThe participants of the study were the patients of the Infectious Disease Department of the St. Petersburg State Health Care Institution \u2018City Hospital No. 40, Kurortny District\u2019 who were admitted for treatment with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction), and healthy individuals. Healthy individuals are defined as people who did not require COVID-19 medical treatment at the time of the study (between April 2020 and March 2022). Table 1 shows the participants\u2019 characteristics. Of the 982 participants who passed quality control (Supplementary Figure 1), 431 (44%) were female, with a mean age of 60 years, while for 551 (56%) male participants, the mean age was 56 years. Overall, 814 (83%) of all participants had COVID-19, of which 319 (39%) had severe COVID-19. Separation according to the severity of the disease was carried out according to the clinical and radiological data (Methods). The case group included 319 patients (199 men and 120 women, 63 \u00b1 14 years) with the severe and extremely severe course of COVID-19. The control group, which combined mild and moderate forms of COVID-19, as well as healthy individuals, included 663 patients (352 men and 311 women, 56 \u00b1 16 years).

To evaluate the efficiency of LP-WGS in the PRS context, we calculated PRS values for a participant (not included in the study population) sequenced in each of the batches to control the quality of the sequencing process. The coefficient of variation (CV) was equal to 0.5%, demonstrating excellent technical reproducibility. Testing associations between PRS and COVID-19 severityUsing the summary-statistics-based approach, leveraging information from a robust meta-analysis, we developed a PRS model, which incorporated 1093542 common genetic variants. Subsequently, we calculated individual PRS values using the obtained PRS model ( Figure 1 ).Figure 1.Study design and workflow. The PRS model for COVID-19 severity was derived by combining summary association statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative consortium and a linkage disequilibrium reference panel of 50,000 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank data set. As a computational algorithm, SBayesR was used, which is a Bayesian approach to calculate a posterior mean effect for all variants based on a prior (effect size in the previous GWAS) and subsequent shrinkage based on linkage disequilibrium. The PRS model was restricted by the list of variants from HapMap3 and included about one million variants. Across the study population, the PRS was normally distributed with the prevalence of severe COVID-19 rising in the right tail of the distribution, from 15% in the lowest decile to around 50% in the highest decile ( Figure 2 ). We compared the distributions of PRS values between severe cases and the control group. Comparison of the mean PRS values, performed using Student\u2019s t-test for two independent samples, showed a significant difference (p-value = 1e-07), with PRS values larger in severe cases ( Figure 3 ). Next, we found that the 10% of the population with the highest PRS values had an OR = 2.3 for COVID-19 (95% CI: 1.5\u20133.6, p-value = 0.0001).Figure 2.Prevalence of the severe COVID-19 according to PRS decile. All participants (N = 982) were stratified by decile of the PRS distribution. The average prevalence in per cent and 95% CI within each decile are displayed.

Adjusted and ROC analysisWe analysed the association between PRS and severe COVID-19 using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for sex, age, comorbidities, and the first ten principal components of genetic variation. In the adjusted model, a highly significant association between PRS and severe COVID-19 was found: OR = 1.54 per standard deviation (95% CI: 1.3\u20131.8 with p-value = 2e-08, Supplementary Table 8). High values of PRS (the 10% of PRS distribution) were associated with the adjusted OR = 2.9 (95% CI: 1.8\u20134.6, p-value = 4e-06, Supplementary Table 9). With the applied cross-validation approach, the analysis showed moderate improvements in AUC with the addition of PRS to the base model containing only covariates (Supplementary Table 10). The model predicting the risk of severe COVID-19 had an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.6\u20130.76 by the formula given by Hanley and McNeil [ 38 ]) for a model excluding PRS, and it increased up to 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62\u20130.79) when PRS was included ( Figure 4 ). However, given the limited sample size, this result was insignificant (p-value > 0.05 for increment in AUC). The PRS-only model had an AUC of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.52\u20130.69, Supplementary Table 11).Figure 4.The comparison of receiving operating curves for three logistic regression models. The full model included the covariates (sex, age, comorbidities, and the first ten PCs) and the PRS, while the covariates-only model excluded the PRS. Testing associations between PRS and COVID-19 mortalityThe severe form of the disease is associated with an increased risk of death. We compared the mean PRS values for groups with different COVID-19 outcomes (death vs no death or no disease). Results showed a significant difference in mean PRS (p-value = 0.006, Figure 5 ).Figure 5.Comparison of distributions of PRS values between the groups with and without death outcome. (a) Distribution of PRS in the groups with (N death = 133) and without (N no death = 849) death outcome of COVID-19. The x-axis represents PRS, with values scaled to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (in the total sample) to facilitate interpretation. (b) PRS values among cases versus controls. Within each box plot, the horizontal lines reflect the median, the top, and bottom of each box reflect the interquartile range, and the whiskers reflect the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be \u2018outliers\u2019. Then, to assess how much the risk of death is associated with an increased PRS value, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) for death between the group with the highest PRS values (10%) and others. The resulting OR was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1\u20133.4) with p-value = 0.01. Thus, in the group with the highest PRS values, the probability of death due to severe disease was almost doubled. In an adjusted model with the same covariates as in the analysis of COVID-19 severity, a significant association between PRS and COVID-19 mortality was found: OR = 1.5 per standard deviation (95% CI: 1.2\u20131.9 with p-value = 0.0007, Supplementary Table 12). High values of PRS (the 10% of PRS distribution) were associated with the adjusted OR = 4.3 (95% CI: 2.2\u20138.5, p-value = 2e-05, Supplementary Table 13). PRS-based survival analysis for COVID-19 severity and mortalityNext, we hypothesized that PRS for severe COVID-19 would be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 in early age. In Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses, which is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data, we divided the sample into three groups: 10% of all individuals with the highest PRS values, 10% of all individuals with the lowest PRS values, and the rest ( Figure 6 ). The analysis showed that people from the group with high PRS values started to have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in comparison with other groups already before the age of 40 years (p-value < 2e-8 for the log-rank test). For example, the average risk of a severe course, which is reached at the age of 60 years, in the group with the highest PRS is reached before 50 years of age. Adjustment for covariates (sex, comorbidities, and the first ten PCs of genetic variation) using a multivariate Cox regression analysis showed similar results (Supplementary Figure 2) with the hazard ratio (HR) for PRS = 1.39 (p-value < 1e-7, Supplementary Table 14). The same analysis for the COVID-19 mortality showed similar results, where people from the group of high PRS values started to have an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 in comparison with other groups already before the age of 50 years (p-value < 2e-6 for the log-rank test, Supplementary Figures 3 and 4) with HR for PRS = 1.44 (p-value < 1e-3, Supplementary Table 15).Figure 6.Association of PRS with COVID-19 severity. All participants (N = 982) were stratified into three categories, based on their PRS: bottom decile, deciles 2\u20139, and top decile. The Kaplan\u2013Meier curve is plotted according to the PRS category.", "header": "RESULTS"}, {"body": "In this study, we constructed a polygenic risk model for predicting the severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 and applied it to a target cohort of 982 Russian participants. Comparing the distributions of a PRS, incorporating information from more than one million common genetic variants, between the case and control groups revealed significant differences, indicating meaningful associations between the PRS and COVID-19 severity and mortality. We also demonstrated the potential of LP-WGS with 5x coverage to be used for PRS calculation followed by genetic predisposition prediction. Our main objective was to evaluate the predictive ability of PRS for COVID-19 severity in a population of Eastern European ancestry. To achieve this, we developed a logistic regression model that included demographic and clinical covariates and the full model that also incorporated the PRS. Comparison between these models demonstrated that incorporating PRS moderately enhanced the predictive accuracy. These findings align with a previous analysis by Huang et al. [ 16 ], where PRS values for severe COVID-19 were constructed using 112 SNPs in 430,582 participants from the UK Biobank study. In that work, AUC was calculated for a model including only covariates and for the full model, which also included the PRS. For the first model, the AUC was 0.789, while in the full mode, the AUC was 0.794 (p-value = 0.002 for increment in AUC). The higher overall prediction accuracy of the model could be attributed to the usage of information on additional covariates (hypertension, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and body mass index). Although our PRS, based on approximately one million SNPs, offered stronger improvement in AUC (0.026 in our study vs 0.005 in Huang et al.), this result was insignificant, given the limited sample size of our study. The higher contribution of the PRS in our case can be explained by the much larger number of genetic variants used but also by fewer clinical factors in our model. Indeed, it is often observed that adding a predictor to a model having a high AUC improves it by an amount smaller than what could be achieved by adding the same factor to a poorer model. Furthermore, stratifying individuals by PRS quantiles revealed an association with a distinctive risk of severe COVID-19 in resulting groups. The highest PRS categories exhibited higher (adjusted OR up to 2.9 for the top 10% PRS) risk. This genetic basis for differences in disease severity among individuals also extended to the occurrence of mortality due to COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 4.3 for the top 10% PRS). These results demonstrate that polygenic risks can be employed to stratify patients and assess their risk of severe disease and mortality related to COVID-19. Additional survival analysis revealed that the highest risk categories as defined by PRS not only exhibited higher risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality but also experienced an earlier onset of increased risk compared to the mean- and low-risk categories. These findings provide insights into both the overall risk for severe COVID-19 and how the risk varies by age. The application of PRS in clinical settings presents many challenges. However, recent research has demonstrated their potential utility in the realm of healthcare, spanning a wide array of diseases [ 40 \u2013 42 ]. As an illustrative example, the extended Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) model is employed to assess the risks of breast and ovarian cancer, by integrating various factors including personal risk indicators, familial cancer history, mammographic density, an assortment of lifestyle and hormonal aspects, genetic screening for high- and moderate-risk genes, as well as polygenic scores [ 43 ]. The validation of this model in a Dutch prospective cohort, with regard to breast cancer risk prediction, has demonstrated that the incorporation of PRS enhances the discriminatory capability from 0.53 to 0.64, compared to a model based solely on age, which currently serves as the sole determinant for breast cancer screening recommendations in the Dutch population [ 44 ]. Our study findings have indicated that the application of PRS in the context of COVID-19 holds potential implications for stratifying individuals according to their genetic predisposition towards disease severity. In addition, several studies have found the positive impact of informing patients about their increased polygenic risk on behavioural patterns. For example, research has shown that when people are aware of their increased polygenic risk for certain diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, they are more likely to engage in healthier lifestyles, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and regular health checkups [ 45 ]. These behavioural changes can have a significant impact on disease prevention and treatment, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes. By providing patients with a thorough understanding of their genetic risk profiles, healthcare providers can encourage proactive measures to reduce potential risks and promote long-term health and well-being. A few limitations of our study should be noted. First, despite the multi-ethnic and global nature of the HGI Release 7 meta-analysis, the participants were mostly of Western European descent [ 9 ]. While polygenic scores that incorporate GWAS data from diverse ancestries in addition to the target population have shown relative improvement in predictive accuracy compared to methods that rely solely on GWAS data from a single ancestry source [ 46 ], incorporating more genetic data from non-Western European populations into these models is expected to enhance their predictive accuracy, particularly for individuals from underrepresented populations. Second, the lack of specific clinical data required to accurately match the severity criteria used by the HGI consortium may have led to some inaccuracy in the classification of outcome measures for some participants. Our study has several strengths. First, we evaluated the performance of polygenic risk models in the Russian population, which is a valuable contribution to understanding the limitations of PRS applicability, particularly in light of the over-representation of Western European population data in existing models. Secondly, for complex traits, previous research has shown that even the strongest GWAS hits tend to have modest effect sizes on risk and that all the genome-wide significant hits in combination explain only a small fraction of the disease risk heritability [ 47 ]. Subsequent studies have largely resolved this initial mystery by demonstrating that most of the missing heritability is due to numerous small-effect common variants that are not significant at current sample sizes [ 48 , 49 ]. In this work, we employed a wide range of common SNPs for PRS calculation, which is an important addition to previously published models for severe COVID-19 prediction, where PRS values were calculated using only the most significant SNPs. Finally, recent publications have proposed the use of LP-WGS in conjunction with genotype imputation as an alternative to genotyping arrays for trait mapping and polygenic score calculation [ 24 ]. In our study, we also demonstrated good model performance using PRS based on LP-WGS data.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}, {"body": "Nostaeva et al. supplementary material 1Nostaeva et al. supplementary material Nostaeva et al. supplementary material 2Nostaeva et al. supplementary material", "header": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

The purpose of this study was to identify key predictors of high hospital charges for infective endocarditis at a major university-affiliated cardiac care centre in West Virginia. A retrospective electronic medical records\u2019 review was undertaken of all adult patients admitted for endocarditis between 2014\u20132018. Multiple linear regression analysis assessed the total charges billed to the patient account for their endocarditis hospitalization in the medical record. Hospital charges have increased 12-fold during 2014\u20132018. Among the 486 patients, the median hospital charge was $198 678. About 47% of the patients underwent surgery incurring 70% of the total charges. Patients with hospital stays of \u226550 days accounted for a third of all charges. The multiple linear regression model accounted for 85% of the linear variance in the hospital charges. Median charges increased by 30.87% for patients with \u22659 consultations, 60.32% for those who died in the hospital, and 81.85% for those who underwent surgical intervention. The study findings showed that complex care requiring multiple consultations, surgical interventions, and longer hospital stays were significantly associated with higher hospital charges for endocarditis treatment.", "sections": {"chapters": [{"body": "The United States (U.S.) has a reported infective endocarditis (IE) incidence of 15/100 000 which is considered the highest global IE rate [ 1 ]. Hospitalization rates for IE in the U.S. continue to increase, placing a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Factors contributing to the escalating hospital charges for IE include the pre-disposing factor of injection drug use and intensive medical management requiring diagnostic tests, extended hospitalizations, long-term intensive antibiotic therapy, and surgical interventions. The financial burden reflected in the total healthcare cost of IE-related hospitalizations has increased significantly from $1.58 billion in 2003 to $2.34 billion in 2016, with hospitalizations increasing from 34 488 to 54 405 per 100 000 during this period [ 2 ]. A significant factor driving the high cost of hospitalization for IE is the intensive management of the disease through antibiotics and/or surgery. While oral antibiotics can be effective, standard antibiotics can be compromised for some patients due to their inaccessibility of cardiac structures [ 3 ]. In these cases, surgery is the recommended course of action. Surgical treatment is a significant factor contributing to overall hospital charges for patients with IE. The total charges for hospitalizations involving surgery for 22 825 IE patients in North Carolina between 2007 and 2017 exceeded $400 million [ 4 ]. Specifically, the median charges for drug use associated-IE hospitalizations requiring surgery were significantly higher at $250 994 compared to $198 764 for non-drug use associated--IE surgery hospitalizations [ 4 ]. The high cost for IE may also be attributed to extended length of stay in the hospital to allow healthcare professionals to monitor and manage any post-operative complications, rehabilitation, and follow-up treatment [ 4 \u2013 6 ]. Another important factor changing the epidemiology of IE in the past decade has been injection drug use, frequently requiring higher resource utilization and multidisciplinary care [ 7 ] resulting in substantially higher healthcare costs [ 8 ]. Results from a study using a nationally representative sample of U.S. patients revealed that the total inpatient hospital charges for infections related to opioid abuse, including IE, increased over three-folds from $190 million in 2002 to $700 million in 2012 [ 9 ]. Statewide and single-centre studies demonstrate hospitalization costs for patients with drug use associated-IE were twice as high in comparison to non-drug use associated-IE patients. For example, the median hospital charges for drug use associated-IE hospitalizations were $47 899 compared to $26 460 for non-drug use associated-IE hospitalizations in a single- centre study conducted during 2000\u20132016 [ 8 ]. Another statewide study also showed this contrast with median charges for drug use associated--IE hospitalizations at $60 333 vs. $34 968 for non-drug use associated-IE hospitalizations between 2007 and 2017 [ 4 ]. The higher readmissions of IE patients have been another significant source of elevated hospital costs. In a study utilizing the 2017 national readmissions database, 23% of all 56 357 hospitalizations for IE were readmitted within 30 days after their initial discharge [ 10 ]. The median hospitalization cost for patients during their initial admission was $20 241 [ 10 ]. However, when IE patients were readmitted, the median hospitalization cost increased to $22 059, indicating that the financial burden was much higher on readmission than initial admission [ 10 ]. Additionally, living in rural areas has been shown to be a predictor of poorer overall health outcomes and higher medical costs [ 11 \u2013 12 ]. Admissions for IE in West Virginia (WV) experienced a significant increase of 456% between 2014 and 2018 [ 7 ]. A single- centre study in southern WV recorded 462 cases of IE between 2008 and 2015, resulting in hospital charges exceeding $17 million [ 12 ]. On average, a total of $70 000 was spent per patient with IDU-IE but only 22% ($3 829 701) were collected [ 12 ]. Another WV study examining IE patients who underwent tricuspid valve operations from 2012 to 2018 at West Virginia University Medical Centre showed that drug use associated-IE patients incurred significantly higher charges (totalling $291 037) compared to non-drug use associated-IE patients (totalling $235 620) [ 13 ]. Additionally, procedures associated with drug use had lower median reimbursement, at $42 063, compared to those not associated with drug use, at $70 393 [ 13 ]. The WV healthcare system continues to sustain losses of over $8 billion in gross domestic product annually due to the ongoing opioid epidemic [ 14 , 15 ]. The high cost of hospitalization highlights the significant financial burden placed on patients and healthcare systems. The purpose of this study is to examine the healthcare burden measured as hospital charges and associated factors for patients with IE in the largest hospital in WV.", "header": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"body": "Study design, data sources, and variablesA retrospective review was conducted manually of electronic medical records (EMR) for all patients aged 18 to <90 years, who had their index admission for IE at a major university-affiliated hospital in WV between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018. Patients with IE were initially identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes and confirmed by detailed chart reviews. The data were abstracted for each patient from several sources within the EMR, such as laboratory tests, imaging results, note-taking on patient history, physical examination, consultations, surgeries, hospital stays, and discharge summaries. The number of subsequent admissions was recorded to obtain data on the frequency of readmissions during the study period. Information collected from EMR was entered into a HIPAA-compliant, secure dataset using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system [ 16 ]. The outcome variable was hospital charges defined as total charges billed to the patient account for their IE hospitalization corresponding to their admission and discharge dates in the EMR. Hospital charges were explained by characteristics related to the year of admission, demographics, substance use, clinical features, and hospital utilization. Demographic characteristics were classified by sex (male and female) and age (18\u201344; 45\u201364; >64 years). Substance use was described by smoking status (current smoker, ex-smoker, and non-smoker), alcohol use (current alcohol use, prior alcohol use, and no alcohol use), history of drug use (yes/no), and type of drug used. Clinical characteristics were explained by comorbidities, number of comorbidities, psychiatric disorders, causative organism, and type of IE (tricuspid, mitral, aortic, and pulmonic). Lastly, hospital utilization was broken down by consultations received; surgery for IE (yes/no), length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, discharge status (alive, against medical advice, and death), and readmission during the study period. Statistical analysesDescriptive statistics was performed on categorical variables as counts and percentages. Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The primary outcome variable, hospital charges, was a continuous variable, presented separately as total charge as well as average (median) charge per person and the interquartile range for each variable. The medians were compared using the nonparametric independent samples median test. Variables with significant associations were selected in the multiple regression model. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the key dependent variable, hospital charges, and key predictor variables/potential confounders: age (continuous), history of drug use (yes/no), length of stay (continuous), surgery (yes/no), and number of consultations (0\u20135, 6\u20138, \u22659). Assumptions meeting multiple linear regression were tested. These tests included sample size appropriateness, linearity, multicollinearity, normality of residuals, and testing for regression outliers. The initial study sample had 492 patients. Regression outliers were tested using leverage plots, studentized residuals, and Cook\u2019s D. The five lowest observations and one highest observation in the residuals were identified as outliers and excluded from the analyses. Therefore, this study had 486 patients. The data normality of residuals was tested using the P\u2013P plot. Natural log transformation was applied to the variable \u2018total hospital charges\u2019. The relationship between the length of hospital stay and hospital charges was curvilinear. Hence, to improve the linearity between the dependent and independent variables, and to boost the validity of statistical analyses, natural log transformation was also applied to the variable length of hospital stay. The multicollinearity assumption was tested using the Variance Inflation Factor. The predictor variables of interest were less than 5. All assumptions to use a multiple linear regression analysis were met in the model. The final model included the dependent variable, total hospital charges, with the following variables that were significant in the bivariate association (age, alcohol use, length of hospital stay, surgery, substance abuse, number of drugs, and psychiatric disorders). Omnibus model fit was addressed with regression F test and an alpha of \u22640.05 was utilized. Adjusted R Square was used to test the effect size of the overall final model. Unstandardized and standardized beta coefficients with standard error were calculated for the multiple regression analyses. The relative effect of each factor on hospital charges was assessed by calculating: (a) the percent change for categorical variables compared to the reference category; or (b) per x units of a continuous variable (e.g. age in years) or log-transformed units of hospital length of stay. The percent change was calculated using the following formula: Percent Change = (exp (beta-k \u00d7 units-k) \u2212 1) \u00d7 100 where beta-k is the regression coefficient estimate and units-k are the units of measure for the regression coefficient k. The percent change for categorical variables was evaluated relative to the reference category and was interpreted alongside the intercept reference. Statistical significance was considered when the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not contain 0.

There was a similar distribution of male and female patients with IE. Participants aged 18\u201344 years comprised almost two-thirds (62%) of the total patients and hospital charges. Additionally, over two-thirds (66%) of patients were current smokers, representing a majority of total charges among this subgroup. An even higher proportion (70%) of patients had a history of drug use, and they incurred over three-quarters of the hospital charges ($85.5 million). Table 1 also presents the types of drugs used by participants prior to their hospital admission. Among these patients, 59% had used opiates, including fentanyl, carfentanyl, heroin, codeine, morphine, and oxycodone, accounting for healthcare charges totalling $74 million. The clinical and surgical characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 2 . Comorbidities played a significant role in the financial burdens associated with IE. The presence of multiple comorbidities in individuals corresponded to a greater increase in overall charges. Over 58% of the patients had some form of psychiatric disorder, which incurred hospital charges amounting to $70 million. Of the patients with psychiatric disorders, 44.6% had substance use problems. About 42% of the patients had tricuspid valve-affected IE incurring the most charges, followed by mitral valve-affected IE (34%). Among the causative organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) associated IE incurred the highest charges, followed by methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA)-associated IE.Table 2.Clinical characteristics VariablesN%Total charges (million U.S. $)%Median charges (U.S. $)IQR b p-value b Comorbidities Psychiatric disorders28358.2369.9962.51234 274207 683<0.001 Hypertension17636.2136.9432.99170 148221 0220.006 Type 2 diabetes8918.3118.3316.37143 391214 6660.01 Coronary artery disease7515.4314.6813.11164 300166 6730.003 Chronic lung disease6112.5513.6212.17171 757247 4410.1 Hyperlipidaemia7014.4014.2912.77155 635250 1980.014 Acute kidney injury306.178.327.43213 791225 5460.85 Chronic kidney disease489.8811.5210.29141 966308 1060.048 Stroke408.237.706.88162 733147 6450.013 Peripheral vascular disease418.449.598.56163 877272 1530.192Metastatic infections193.913.663.27152 575181 9580.16 Cancer326.586.996.24138 150179 5970.1 Number of comorbidities 0.002 05411.1112.2510.94206 343216 537120441.9850.5245.13235 495203 47629018.5218.7616.75168 856200 225\u2265313828.4030,4327.18164 088231 874Psychiatric disorders Substance use disorder21744.6557.0850.99255 043200 6990.001 Depression14028.8135.2031.44236 640205 7080.057Anxiety12826.3434.3630.69256 714207 572<0.001 Bipolar disorder316.387.546.73241 159273 8690.458Post-traumatic stress disorder357.208.347.45232 231181 2860.483Causative organisms MRSA \u2013 Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin resistant15431.6938.9334.77229 621211 5290.205MSSA \u2013 Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin sensitive14028.8133.8630.24233 017221 7920.021 Other streptococci species6413.1711.6910.44180 352171 5610.687Enterococcus species5310.9112.0410.75171 537228 5490.244Candida species438.8514.4712.92289 260321 8100.025 Serratia species336.798.397.49237 029212 5450.279Culture negative183.703.403.04143 605200 2640.23Viridans streptococci173.504.383.91194 752230 4911Klebsiella species122.474.313.85293 911456 0980.381Other5310.9111.4210.20171 170207 5540.244Type of infective endocarditis Tricuspid20642.3951.9146.36236 445207 219<0.001 Mitral16734.3642.0037.51216 5031,691 5920.849Aortic13627.9834.2030.55189 211242 3290.613Pulmonic122.473.072.74228 715249 1040.77 Note: Total Charges do not add to 100% for variables where categories are not mutually exclusive. aInterquartile range. bValues in bold indicate statistical significance.

The multiple linear regression model accounted for 85% of the linear variance in the dependent variable (natural log of total hospital charges) adjusting for model complexity (Adjusted R2 = 0.849), indicating a large association between the predictor variables selected in the model ( Table 4 ). In the adjusted model, the percent increases in median charges for consultations were as follows:1\u20135 consultations, $89 865; 6\u20138 consultations, $211 503 (11.18% increase); and \u2265 9 consultations, $321 965 (30.87% increase). Compared to patients who were discharged home, there was a 60.32% increase in the median charges for patients who died in the hospital. Similarly, relative to patients treated by medical management alone, patients who had surgical intervention incurred an 81.85% increase in median charges (beta coefficient 0.598, 95% CI 0.528\u20130.669). Within the full model, a statistically significant association was observed between total hospital charges and length of hospital stay (beta coefficient 0.662, 95% CI 0.617\u20130.708).Table 4.Multiple linear regression of hospital charges B#Standard error\u03b2##tp-value a 95% Confidence interval% ChangeLowerUpperConstant9.290.1276.98<0.001 9.0579.531Surgery0.600.040.3416.59<0.001 0.5280.66981.85In-hospital death0.470.060.168.34<0.001 0.3610.58460.32Length of stay (log-transformed)0.660.020.6728.44<0.001 0.6170.70815.92Consultations 6\u201380.110.040.062.680.008 0.0280.18311.18Consultations \u2265 90.270.050.145.63<0.001 0.1750.36330.87Discharge against medical advice0.010.050.000.150.877\u22120.0860.1010.70Age0.000.000.072.540.011 0.0010.0070.40Current/former smoker0.010.050.000.190.85\u22120.0910.111.01Comorbidities0.030.040.020.760.448\u22120.0520.1173.36Drug use0.010.050.010.230.819\u22120.0910.1151.21Note: Dependent Variable: Hospital charges is natural log transformed.

In this study, the admissions at one hospital system with a catch basin of the state of WV rose from 1.56 admissions/100 000 population in 2014 to 9.94/100 000 in 2018. Additionally, the median charge per IE patient in the WV hospital system grew from $81 965 per patient in 2014 to triple that amount ($244,632) in 2018. With a minor rise in inflation during that period (0.8% in 2014 and 1.9% in 2018), this is an extreme rise in patient management charges. The hospital charges in West Virginia for patients with IE are substantially higher than the national estimates. At the national level, the mean inflation-adjusted cost per admission decreased from $45 810 in 2003 to $43 020 in 2016 [ 2 ]. The demographic and clinical characteristics of IE patients shed light on the factors driving these escalating costs. Surgery significantly contributed to the rising financial challenges associated with IE in our study. Nationally, IE surgeries increased by 1.7-fold during 2011\u20132018 [ 17 ]; however, there was a 26-fold increase in WV during 2014\u20132018 [ 18 ]. Patients undergoing surgical treatment for IE require pre-operative and post-operative hospital care [ 18 , 19 ], which adds significantly to the overall charges. Furthermore, patients admitted to the ICU following surgery further escalate these costs [ 20 ]. Patients undergoing surgical treatment for IE require an increased demand for hospital resources, which also contributes to the overall cost [ 18 , 20 ]. In a study conducted among 369 patients who underwent surgical intervention for IE, the financial burden on the healthcare system was the median charge of $60 072 per patient [ 21 ]. Patients who undergo surgical procedures during hospital admissions typically experience longer hospital stays compared to those who do not have surgery [ 4 , 8 , 18 , 22 , 23 ]. Patients who had multiple comorbidities contributed to a greater increase in overall healthcare costs. Having multiple medical conditions can lead to increased use of healthcare services and higher associated costs [ 24 ]. Treatment for individuals with multiple comorbidities requires tailored care that may extend over a longer duration [ 25 \u2013 27 ], resulting in prolonged hospital stays, and increased overall charges [ 21 ]. A notable proportion of IE patients had a history of drug use, representing a majority of the total healthcare costs. While nationally, the prevalence of substance use among patients hospitalized for IE was 21% during 2015\u20132019 [ 28 ], the prevalence was substantially higher for WV patients [ 7 ]. Treating IE in individuals who use drugs requires extensive and costly multidisciplinary care [ 29 ]. A previous study found that in 2015, patients with drug use-associated IE accounted for a total of $9.3 million in healthcare costs [ 30 ]. The cost of hospitalizations for cases of IE that are associated with opioid use doubled between 2003 and 2016 [ 11 ]. The amount of money spent on hospitalizations for opioid-associated infections has increased at a much faster rate than the actual increase in the number of individuals being hospitalized for these issues [ 9 ]. Even after accounting for inflation, the rise in costs remains high relative to the increase in hospitalizations [ 9 ]. Factors such as escalating treatment expenses, greater resource use, and increased severity of illness all contribute to these elevated costs [ 9 ]. In this study, MRSA-associated IE incurred the highest charges. MRSA infections can be serious, and there are significant costs associated with treating these infections. In a study on patients hospitalized in the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system in the U.S., MRSA was the pathogen with the highest aggregate cost of $1.2 billion for community-onset infections and $580.2 million for hospital-onset infections in 2017 [ 31 ]. The authors concluded that MRSA infections had the highest total aggregate cost nationally because of their heavy financial burden. Lastly, specific geographic and cultural aspects of the rural landscape add a burden to healthcare costs. Researchers have frequently concluded that rural populations are more likely to be poor, lack health insurance, engage in risky behaviours, and be sicker compared to their urban counterparts [ 32 , 33 ]. Patients in rural areas have to travel greater distances to access healthcare, which is costly and requires time away from work. In addition, rural topography and transportation challenges add further barriers to accessing healthcare centres. Rural populations also face decreased access to home health or psychiatric resources and stigma regarding drug use [ 34 ]. Studies from other rural Appalachian states also indicate a similar trend in hospitalization due to IE [ 35 ]. Since these states face more financial challenges, the burden added by the steeply rising IE hospitalizations is more significant. Strengths and limitationsThis study is strengthened by the exhaustive search of EMR from the premier hospital in WV that treats IE. Unlike most studies that have relied solely on ICD codes, our study further validated the initial IE diagnosis based on ICD codes with several clinical indicators retrieved from a comprehensive manual medical chart review of each patient. In addition, the manual chart review provided validated information on clinical and substance use-associated characteristics. Another strength of the study is that we analyzed data for individual patients and not hospitalizations. We were also able to abstract long-term data, such as the readmissions of the patients, although we did not have information on patient outcomes such as out-of-hospital mortality or subsequent admissions to other hospitals. Our study is subject to other limitations. It is a single-centre study, although the centre is the largest cardiac care centre in WV. In addition, the results are dependent on the data available in the EMR. Information was limited on socio-demographic variables, such as education, income, and duration of drug use. There was a potential for drug use data to be misclassified if patients had not disclosed previous drug use upon hospital admission. This bias was also a study limitation.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}, {"body": "In conclusion, hospital charges related to IE continue to have a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. Many patients with IE in WV required complex care and experienced significant morbidity. Prolonged length of hospital stays, surgeries, readmissions, and other medical consultations and procedures resulted in high hospital charges. The authors believe that interventions need to focus on early diagnosis and treatment of patients with IE to reduce the need for complex care, complications, extended hospitalizations, and the associated high hospital charges.", "header": "CONCLUSION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}

We describe the epidemiology of S. pyogenes pharyngitis and invasive disease in Alberta, Canada 2018\u20132023. Positive pharyngitis specimens were identified from throat swabs collected from pharyngitis patients. Invasive S. pyogenes was defined as the isolation of S. pyogenes from a normally sterile site or severe skin infection. S. pyogenes isolates were emm typed. Pharyngitis and invasive disease displayed seasonal trends preceding the COVID-19 pandemic followed by a sharp decrease during COVID-19 intervention measures. After the lifting of interventions, rates of pharyngitis and invasive disease rose. There were 182 983 positive pharyngitis specimens between 2018 and 2023 for a positivity rate of 17.6%. The highest rates occurred in the 0\u20139 age group in 2023 (41.5%). Invasive disease increased in 2022\u20132023 driven by emm1 and 12 types. M1UK strain was the most frequent M1 type associated with invasive disease (59% of M1 isolates sequenced). Notably, out of 182 983 pharyngitis cases, there were 111 cases of invasive S. pyogenes detected for an invasive disease rate of 0.06%. This descriptive epidemiology of S. pyogenes pharyngitis and invasive S. pyogenes disease highlights the rapid increase in cases of S. pyogenes occurring in western Canada and illustrates the critical need for a vaccine.", "sections": {"chapters": [{"body": "Group A streptococci (S. pyogenes) are Gram-positive facultative anaerobic coccobacilli bacteria that grow as chains. These bacteria are responsible for a collection of different diseases in humans ranging from a mild illness such as pharyngitis (commonly referred to as strep throat) to more severe invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock which are rare in occurrence [ 1 , 2 ]. Cases of S. pyogenes pharyngitis tend to occur more frequently in the early stages of life (0\u20139 years) with some children experiencing multiple episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis [ 3 , 4 ]. An important virulence factor for S. pyogenes is the M protein which is a long-coiled dimerized protein that projects from the Gram-positive cell wall of the bacteria [ 1 , 5 ]. The M protein is encoded by the emm gene of which there are 261 emm types [ 6 , 7 ]. This diversity in emm gene sequence results in multiple M-type proteins with some types more prevalent than others [ 7 , 8 ]. Different emm types occur with greater frequency in low-income regions than in high-income countries where the emm type diversity is much less [ 9 ]. In the last 2 years (2022\u20132023), post-COVID-19 restrictions, the rates of S. pyogenes infections have significantly increased, notably in the UK and Europe as well as the USA and Australia [ 10 - 16 ]. Much of this increase has been driven by a small number of S. pyogenes emm types notably emm1 and emm12. Of the emm1 strains, a strain termed the M1UK S. pyogenes strain is more prevalent in both adults and children than the previously more common M1global strain [ 12 , 17 , 18 ]. The M1UK strain is a hypervirulent S. pyogenes that first appeared in the UK in 2013 and subsequently spread globally [ 19 ]. The objective of this work was to describe the increase in S. pyogenes infections (pharyngitis and invasive disease) in Alberta, Canada from 2018 to 2023 and provide a genomic analysis of a subset of invasive S. pyogenes isolates identified during the increase in cases post-COVID-19 restrictions, from November 2022 to May 2023.", "header": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"body": "Data collection for non-invasive S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimensData on the number of pharyngitis swabs submitted to diagnostic microbiology laboratories in Alberta and the number positive for S. pyogenes was collated from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023 (72 months). This period was selected to include pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic dates as well as overlay with the increase in invasive S. pyogenes infections beginning November 2022. The large data set was extracted from three different Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) used by diagnostic microbiology laboratories in Alberta during this 72-month period (LIS systems were Meditech, Cerner Millennium, and EPIC) and collated into Microsoft Excel format for analysis. Data captured included both throat cultures and molecular assays used for the detection of S. pyogenes from throat swabs. Alberta population estimates (used to standardize incidence calculations) were obtained from the Government of Alberta resource; http://www.ahw.gov.ab.ca/IHDA_Retrieval/ihdaData.do (accessed 1 March 2024). Data collection for invasive S. pyogenes isolatesAn invasive infection caused by S. pyogenes is designated as a Public Health Notifiable Disease in Alberta ( https://open.alberta.ca/publications/streptococcal-disease-group-a-invasive ). Therefore, all cases are reported to public health by the laboratory identifying the case. Invasive S. pyogenes disease was defined as the identification of S. pyogenes from any sterile site including blood, brain cerebrospinal fluid, deep tissues, and joints. All invasive S. pyogenes isolates were identified by diagnostic microbiology laboratories in Alberta and were submitted to the APL-Public Health reference laboratory for emm typing and antimicrobial susceptibility assays for trending analysis. Antibiotic susceptibility assays were performed and interpreted using reference disk diffusion methods as described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute [ 20 ]. Antimicrobials assayed were penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. All antimicrobial disks were purchased from BBL, Oxoid, England. Linkage of invasive S. pyogenes with S. pyogenes pharyngitisCases of invasive S. pyogenes that were identified between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2023, were matched to S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens using the personal healthcare number of each case. This was done to calculate the percentage of known S. pyogenes pharyngitis cases that progressed to known invasive S. pyogenes disease. S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens were considered linked to invasive disease if the positive pharyngitis swab was collected within 7 days pre- and 7 days post-initial diagnosis of invasive S. pyogenes disease. This time frame was selected to capture all cases, as S. pyogenes pharyngitis is typically resolves within four to 5 days [ 21 ]. Emm typing and whole genome sequencingThe method used to emm type invasive S. pyogenes isolates was DNA sequencing of the emm gene as previously described [ 22 , 23 ]. For whole genome sequencing, S. pyogenes DNA was extracted using the MagaZorb DNA Mini-Prep Kit (Promega). Briefly, colonies grown in Todd-Hewitt Broth were centrifuged at 6000 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes and the supernatant was removed. Cells were washed in 12 mM Tris and then lysed in mutanolysin/hyaluronidase lysis solution (62 ml; 10 ml 3 000 U/mL mutanolysin (Sigma), 2 mL of 30 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 50 mL of 10 mM Tris). Lysozyme (15 \u03bcL, 100 mg/mL; Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 700 rpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer F1.5). Proteinase K solution (20 \u03bcL) and RNase A (20 \u03bcL, 20 mg/mL; Qiagen or Invitrogen) were added and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. ATL lysis buffer (200 \u03bcL) was added, and tubes were incubated for 2 h at 56 \u00b0C with shaking at 900 rpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer F1.5). Extracts were centrifuged at 9000 \u00d7 g for 2 minutes and wash, binding, and elution steps were completed with the KingFisher mL Purification System (Thermo Scientific) with Qiagen Buffer EB. Extracted genomic DNA was prepared using a modified Illumina DNA Prep protocol (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.07.22269672v1) on an Eppendorf epMotion (APL-Public Health Laboratory) or Illumina Nextera XT (National Microbiology Laboratory). Genomes were sequenced using a High Output Kit on an Illumina MiniSeq (APL-Public Health Laboratory) or an Illumina NextSeq 500/550 (National Microbiology Laboratory). Bioinformatic analysisRaw sequence data quality was processed through pathogen-seq 1.0.4 (https://github.com/iaoli-dong/pathogenseq); de novo assemblies were generated with SPAdes v3.15.5 using the wrapper Shovill 1.1.0 (github.com/tseemann/shovill), with a minimum length cutoff of 300 bp [ 24 ]. In silico emm-typing was performed using emm-typer 0.2.0 (github.com/MDU-PHL/emmtyper), MLST performed with mlst v2.19.0 (github.com/tseemann/mlst), and virulence factor profiling using abricate 1.0.1 (github.com/tseemann/abricate) using the virulence factor database [ 25 ]. To check if any emm1.0 isolates were the M1UK variant, assembly_snptyper v0.1.0 (github.com/boasvdp/assembly_snptyper) was used [ 19 ]. Phylogenetic trees were generated by providing the filtered core genome alignment generated by Panaroo 1.5.0 to IQ-TREE 2.2.2.7, using 1 000 ultra-fast bootstraps, 1 000 Shimodaira-Hasegawa approximate likelihood ratio tests (SH-aLRT), and ModelFinder [ 26 , 27 ]. The tree was rerooted using the midroot with Gotree 0.4.3, annotated using Arcahaeopteryx 0.9930 beta (sites.google.com/view/archaeopteryx/), metadata management with csvtk 0.30.0 (github.com/shenwei356/csvtk), and ultimately visualized using GraPhlAn 1.1.3 (github.com/biobakery/graphlan) [ 28 ]. The genomic data reported in this study have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence-based Archive as part of the BioProject PRJNA1182376. Statistical analysisThe incidence calculation for invasive S. pyogenes was based on the number of isolates submitted for emm typing. A single isolate per case was counted unless the second isolate was collected greater than 30 days post from the first isolate. Data were graphed using OriginLab software 2023 (OriginLab Corporation, https://originlab.com). Summary data was divided into three time periods for analysis; pre-COVID-19 years (2018\u20132019), years impacted by COVID-19 restrictions (2020\u20132022), and years\u2019 post-COVID-19 restrictions (2023). Chi-square tests to compare study indicators between time periods were performed using R, Version 3.4.3 GUI 1.70 (2016) (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). EthicsEthics approval for this study was obtained from the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board (REB).

The number of pharyngitis swabs collected monthly varied from a low of 3 929 swabs (December 2020) to a high of 28 662 swabs (March 2023). The month with the greatest number of positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis swabs was March 2023 (10 321 swabs \u2013 36.0% positivity rate) ( Figure 1 ).Figure 1. Streptococcus pyogenes positive specimens from cases of pharyngitis in Alberta. The columns indicate the number of positive specimens for each month over the six-year period. The line indicates the percent positivity. The horizontal gray bar indicates when Alberta imposed province wide Public Health restrictions (12 March 2020\u201314 June 2022). All ages are included in the data. Overall, S. pyogenes positivity for pharyngitis swabs was significantly higher in 2023 vs. 2018\u20132019 (p < 0.0001). From January 2018 to March 2020 (pre-COVID-19), positive specimens for S. pyogenes pharyngitis for all age groups displayed seasonality peaking during winter months (December, January, and February) ( Figure 1 ). From April 2020 to February 2022, positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimen numbers dropped to 1 000/month or fewer. The drop in submissions starting April 2020 coincided with the implementation of Public Health intervention measures mandated by the provincial government due to COVID-19 on 12 March 2020 [ 29 ]. These were lifted on 14 June 2022, approximately 2 years later ( Figure 1 ) [ 30 ]. The age group with the greatest number of positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens was the 0\u20139 years age group with 2023 having the highest annual percent positivity (41.5% (28 027/67 511)) ( Figure 2a ). Ages 30\u201339 showed the second highest positivity rate in all years except 2021, and in 2023, 30.0% of submitted specimens for this age group were positive for S. pyogenes (Figure 2a). For both the 0\u20139 and 30\u201339 age groups, S. pyogenes positivity for pharyngitis swabs was significantly higher vs. the pooled value of all other ages (p < 0.0001). Presenting the data as incidence per 1 000 specimens shows the 0\u20139-year-old age group most severely affected by S. pyogenes pharyngitis ( Figure 2b ). During COVID-19 restrictions, the years 2020 and 2021 had the lowest incidence per 1 000.Figure 2. Streptococcus pyogenes positive pharyngitis specimens based on age and year. (a.) The percent of positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis from 2018 to 2023 by age group. S. pyogenes positivity was significantly higher in the 0\u20139- and 30\u201339-year-old age categories vs. the pooled value of all other ages (p < 0.0001). (b.) The incidence per 1 000 cases of S. pyogenes pharyngitis in Alberta from 2018 to 2023 by age group (http://www.ahw.gov.ab.ca/IHDA_Retrieval/ihdaData.do). The incidence of invasive S. pyogenes based on isolates submitted for emm typing showed a rise in incidence rates beginning in 2014 (4.6/100 000) with rates peaking in 2020 (11.4/100 000) and then dropping in 2021 ( Figure 3 ). This was followed by a large increase in 2023 to 19 cases/100 000. Analysis of invasive cases from January 2018 to March 2020 (pre-pandemic) for all ages showed invasive S. pyogenes case numbers averaged 36.5 cases/month and from April 2020 to October 2022 (pandemic) cases averaged 34.7 cases/month. From November 2022 to December 2023 (upsurge period) this significantly increased to 72.9 cases/month (over 2-fold rise) with the greatest number of cases occurring in April 2023 (95 cases) ( Figure 4 .). The incidence of invasive S. pyogenes was significantly higher in 2023 vs. 2018\u20132019 for adults (>14 years of age) and children (\u226414 years of age) (p < 0.0001). For children 14 years of age and under, the average number of cases/month was 2.5 from January 2018 to October 2022, and from November 2022 to December 2023, this increased to 12.5/month (a 5-fold increase).Figure 3.The incidence per 100 000 of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease in Alberta from 2003 to 2023 (21 years) for the general population. Incidence is based on the number of invasive S. pyogenes isolates submitted for emm typing as per notifiable disease reporting requirements. The highest incidence occurred in 2023 at 18.9/100 000. Figure 4.Cases of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease from 2018 to 2023 by month. Adult is defined as individuals >14 years of age. Child is defined as individuals \u226414 years of age. The most frequent emm types in 2022 for adults were emm74, 49, 41, and 82. This changed in 2023 with emm1 and emm12 becoming the predominant emm types followed by emm92, emm41, and emm53 ( Figure 5a ). The proportion of invasive S. pyogenes that were emm1 or 12 vs. other types was significantly higher in 2023 vs. 2018\u20132019 (p < 0.0001). For children during both 2022 and 2023, most cases of invasive S. pyogenes were attributed to emm1 and emm12 with other emm types rarely seen ( Figure 5b ).Figure 5. emm types of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes cases for adults and children. (a.) The number of invasive S. pyogenes disease by emm type for adults (>14 years of age) in 2022 and 2023. (b.) The emm types of invasive S. pyogenes disease for children (\u226414) in 2022 and 2023. In comparison to adults, there are few cases in this age group except for emm1 and emm12. During the last 2 years of the survey (2022\u20132023), there were 43 emm types identified ( Figure 5a and 5b ). As emm1 and 12 cases had increased in comparison to all other emm types, we took a closer look at these emm types over the six-year survey period. Figure 6 presents the number of cases of only emm1 and emm12. From January 2018 to April 2020 (pre-COVID-19 interventions), emm1 and emm12 averaged under five cases per month. Case numbers for emm1 and 12 decreased in April/May 2020 (the start of SARS-CoV-2 restriction period) and then increased sharply starting in October 2022 after the lifting of restrictions ( Figure 6 .).Figure 6.The number of cases of invasive emm1 and emm12 Streptococcus pyogenes from 2018 to 2023 by month. All ages are included. The collection of positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens provided us with the opportunity to identify invasive S. pyogenes cases that also had documented S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Of the 182 983 specimens of laboratory-confirmed S. pyogenes pharyngitis over the six-year period from 2018 to 2023, 111 cases (0.06% (60.7/100 000)) also presented with invasive S. pyogenes disease within 7 days of S. pyogenes pharyngitis diagnosis (Supplemental Table S1). Sixty-five (57.5%) of these cases were male. Thirty-three (29.5%) were associated with emm1 (including subtypes) and sixteen (14.3%) were associated with emm12 (including subtypes). Thirty-five (31.3%) of the cases with S. pyogenes pharyngitis and invasive S. pyogenes disease were 14 years of age and under. Of these 35 cases of S. pyogenes pharyngitis linked to invasive disease in children, 45.7% (16/35) were invasive emm1 (including subtypes) and 20% (7/35) were invasive emm12 (including subtypes) (Supplemental Table S1). From 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2023, antimicrobial susceptibility assays were performed on 3 179 invasive S. pyogenes isolates (2018\u2013442 isolates, 2019\u2013433, 2020\u2013469, 2021\u2013398, 2022\u2013519, and 2023\u2013918). All isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. Overall, erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in invasive S. pyogenes cases were significantly higher in 2023 vs. 2018\u20132019 (p < 0.0001). Antimicrobial resistance to erythromycin ranged from a low of 5.3% in 2021 to a high of 15.1% in 2023 ( Table 1 ). This is similar to clindamycin with a low of 4.0% in 2021 and a high of 13.3% in 2023 ( Table 1 ). The most common emm types associated with clindamycin and erythromycin resistance were emm92, 77, 83, and 53 (Supplemental Table S2). Together, these four emm types accounted for 71.4% of erythromycin-resistant isolates and 69.3% of clindamycin-resistant isolates. Of the 591 isolates of emm1 and 12 over the 6 years surveyed, only five were erythromycin resistant and three clindamycin resistant.Table 1.Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance (%) 2018\u20132023 YearErythromycinClindamycinTotal # isolates tested20188.1%7.9%44220196.0%6.7%43320208.5%6.8%46920215.3%4.0%39820228.7%7.7%519202315.1%14.6%878Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was significantly higher in 2023 vs. 2018\u20132019 (p < 0.0001). Genome sequencing was completed for 549 invasive S. pyogenes isolates collected from 1 November 2022 to 31 May 2023 (all emm types) ( Figure 7 and Supplemental Table S3). There were 192 speA isolates (35.0%), 301 speC isolates (54\u22198%), 80 isolates with both speA and speC (14.6%), and 302 with spd1 (55.0%). Of the 134 emm1 isolates sequenced, the genomic analysis showed 79 isolates belonged to the M1UK lineage based on 27 single nucleotide variants in the core genome (59.0% of emm1 cases) and 54 isolates belonged to the M1global strain (40.3%) with one case as M1intermediate ( Figure 7 and Supplemental Table S3). Ninety-eight percent of M1 isolates possessed the speA gene whereas two isolates, (an M1UK and an M1intermediate) did not ( Figure 8a and Supplemental Table S3). The speC gene was present in 33.6% of M1 isolates. Interestingly, the speC gene was present in a distinct branch of the M1UK group and absent in all M1global isolates except for one isolate (Figure 8a and Supplemental Table S3). The emm12 S. pyogenes isolates exhibited higher diversity in comparison to the emm1 stains ( Figure 8b ). Only 19 isolates of the 549 sequenced had all three ssa, speC, and spd1 genes, (three emm12.0, four emm12.4, 11 emm4.0, and one emm58.0) (Supplemental Table S3).Figure 7.Phylogenetic tree analysis of 549 invasive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from November 2022 to May 2023.

Phylogenetic tree of emm12 isolates in Alberta.", "header": "RESULTS"}, {"body": "The data presented for pharyngitis specimens over the 6 years surveyed showed yearly fluctuating changes in positivity rates for S. pyogenes. Prior to the implementation of Public Health interventions for COVID-19, pharyngeal S. pyogenes positivity rates showed a predictable seasonality trend as previously reported by others with the highest rates occurring in winter months and lower in summer [ 4 , 31 , 32 ]. The implementation of Public Health interventions for COVID-19 reduced these rates significantly starting in 2020 [ 29 ]. It was after these restrictions were lifted that pharyngitis S. pyogenes positivity rates sharply increased peaking in March 2023 [ 30 ]. This should not be surprising as these interventions were targeted towards the respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is also a similar transmission route for S. pyogenes. It is unusual though to have such a large increase in cases as it could have been predicted that case numbers would have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels once restrictions were lifted. Breaking down S. pyogenes pharyngitis by age group showed specimens were the most prevalent in the 0\u20139-year-old age group. A study by Mponponsuo et al., analyzed cases of S. pyogenes pharyngitis in Calgary, Alberta from 2010 to 2018 [ 3 ]. This study included 1 074 154 tests, of which 16.6% were positive for S. pyogenes, similar to our study. These investigators found the 5\u201314 age group had the highest positivity rate (42.2%) [ 3 ]. In a recent study by Kline et al., this group found that the 0\u20134 and 5\u20139 age groups also had the most frequent S. pyogenes pharyngitis visits to healthcare providers of all ages [ 4 ]. It is concerning that for the 0\u20139-year-old age group in our study, rates approached nearly 50% positivity, a very high rate of S. pyogenes pharyngitis. A possible reason for this sharp rise in S. pyogenes pharyngitis may include more mixing of this age group as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and children returned to daycares and schools. The increase in S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens was mirrored by increases in S. pyogenes invasive disease. The incidence of invasive disease rose sharply from 9.8/100 000 in 2022 to 19/100 000 in 2023, a significant increase. It should be noted that 2023 was not the first year that the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease began to increase. The incidence of invasive S. pyogenes started to rise in 2014, peaking in 2020. However, the magnitude of the increase over this six-year period was not at the same level as the increase in 2023. The increase in 2023 reflects increases in invasive S. pyogenes disease seen elsewhere such as the UK, other countries in Europe, the USA, and Australia [ 10 , 14 , 33 , 34 ]. The reasons for this steady climb in invasive disease since 2014 are not completely clear and potentially involve several factors. These may include the introduction of new strains, greater vulnerability in the population, and lifting of COVID-19 restrictions leading to increases in population density. Examples include educational institutions resuming in-class instruction and removal of the requirement for masking in areas such as shopping locations. Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, emm1 and 12 were the most frequent emm types associated with invasive disease in Alberta, along with other emm types [ 35 ]. During the COVID-19 restriction period, these two emm types almost disappeared as S. pyogenes bacteria responsible for invasive disease. Once restrictions were lifted, both emm types returned in increased prevalence as the predominant emm types and at higher rates compared to rates pre-COVID-19. Reasons for the emm1 and emm12 resurgence are likely multifactorial including lifting of Public Health interventions thereby allowing the potential for increased respiratory transmission of these emm types. It is interesting that both emm1 and 12 are part of the A-C cluster (emm1:A-C3 and emm12:A-C4), which is considered a cluster associated with the throat as opposed to emm type clusters associated more with cutaneous disease [ 36 ]. The only other A-C emm cluster type found in Alberta from cases of invasive S. pyogenes was emm3, however, invasive disease caused by this emm type has not occurred to the same extent as emm1 and emm12 for reasons which are not well understood. The collection of S. pyogenes pharyngitis data provided an opportunity to determine the rate of S. pyogenes pharyngitis progressing to invasive disease for the Alberta population. For every 100 000 positive S. pyogenes pharyngitis specimens, approximately 61 cases progressed into invasive disease over the six-year period surveyed. This is a crude estimate of the risk of developing invasive disease in patients with pharyngitis as several events occurring during the survey period could have affected the results. A major event was the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as it is likely individuals may have not sought S. pyogenes pharyngitis testing due to adherence to isolation requirements. This coupled with an apparent decrease in S. pyogenes transmission during pandemic years may have skewed the estimate during the pandemic. Also, physicians may not have collected a specimen for a laboratory diagnosis and alternatively prescribed based on symptoms. It should also be noted that pharmacies in Alberta can perform point-of-care tests for S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Those cases of S. pyogenes pharyngitis diagnosed in pharmacies are not captured in the patient\u2019s provincial health record. While these and other variables may affect our estimate of invasive disease occurring during an episode of pharyngitis, an average of 61 cases of invasive disease per every 100 000 cases of pharyngitis over a six-year period we believe is plausible. Both erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in Alberta for invasive S. pyogenes ranged from 4\u20139% from 2018 to 2022 however, in 2023, rates significantly increased to between 14\u201316%. These rates are higher than what we have previously reported for Canada (2018\u20132022) and likely reflect regional differences in circulating strains in Alberta [ 37 ]. Similar to our Alberta study, predominant resistant emm types, emm11, 53, 77, 83, and 92, also have been reported as significant erythromycin-resistant emm types in Canada and the USA [ 37 , 38 ]. It is interesting that emm92 is the most frequently encountered erythromycin/clindamycin resistant emm type as this emm type has been shown to be associated with erythromycin/clindamycin resistant emm92 strains in adult IV drug users in the USA [ 39 ]. Efforts are now being made to determine the demographics of the emm92 iStrep A isolates in our survey study. During the global increase in iStrep A disease, much interest has focused on the M1UK S. pyogenes bacteria as it rapidly expands throughout the world replacing M1global as the predominant M1 type in just a few short years [ 11 , 40 - 42 ]. M1UK was first detected in Alberta in 2016 and is now broadly distributed across Canada [ 37 , 43 ]. For the S. pyogenes isolates for which we sequenced (November 2022 to May 2023), M1UK accounted for close to 60% of the invasive M1 isolates making it the predominant emm type strain over this period. Past reports have shown that M1UK produces high levels of the SpeA exotoxin in comparison to the M1global strain [ 19 ]. Both SpeA and SpeC exotoxin have been shown to be associated with increased fitness and virulence of S. pyogenes strains causing disease [ 19 , 44 , 45 ]. All M1 isolates for which genomic sequencing was completed possessed the speA toxin gene except for two M1UK isolates. The speC gene was less frequent in the M1 isolates. In summary, rates of both S. pyogenes pharyngitis and invasive S. pyogenes disease have substantially increased in Alberta, Canada post-COVID-19. This increase has persisted for over a year since SARS-CoV-2 restrictions were lifted. Invasive disease rates have been driven by predominately two emm types, emm1 and emm12 with M1UK more frequent than M1global.", "header": "DISCUSSION"}, {"body": "Tyrrell et al. supplementary materialTyrrell et al. supplementary material", "header": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION"}]}, "content_type": "research_article"}
